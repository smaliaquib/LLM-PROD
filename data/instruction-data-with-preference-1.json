        "chosen": "Here is the rewritten output:\n\n\"I would like to offer some suggestions based on your description of pain and numbness in your feet and legs that have persisted for about 7 years. Given that you've had a thorough evaluation by multiple doctors, including blood tests, nerve tests, back doctors, and brain scans, I think it's worth exploring other possibilities.\n\nFirstly, I would like to suggest that the issue might be related to your lower back or leg circulation. Have you experienced pain radiating from your back down to your legs? Or is the numbness also present in this area? If so, there could be a possibility of a problem at the spinal or disc level in your lower back.\n\nTo confirm this, I would recommend an MRI scan of your back. If that's positive, it may be worth consulting with an orthopedic specialist for further guidance.\n\nOn the other hand, if the numbness and pain persist despite these tests, there might be a possibility of reduced blood flow to your lower limbs. This could be related to high cholesterol levels, which would require further testing.\n\nI suggest considering a Doppler test to assess circulation in your lower limbs and a cholesterol test to determine your body's cholesterol level. Based on the results, I recommend consulting with a vascular surgeon if the Doppler test is positive or a physician if your cholesterol levels are elevated, and starting treatment accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there might be a possibility of atherosclerosis affecting your lower limb blood vessels, which would also be diagnosed through a Doppler test. If you're interested in exploring this further, I recommend trying to squeeze your calf muscle belly - if it's painful, that could indicate the presence of this condition.\n\nIn the meantime, you may find some relief by soaking your legs in warm water at home, as heat can help relax soft tissues and increase circulation.\n\nFinally, I would encourage you to consider consulting with a physiotherapist who can guide you on developing a lower limb exercise program that will help improve circulation and relax soft tissues. Take care.\"",

        "input": " Dementia Definition Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington\u2019s disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brain\u2019s oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process. Treatment Drugs to specifically treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease and some other progressive dementias are now available. Although these drugs do not halt the disease or reverse existing brain damage, they can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This may improve an individual\u2019s quality of life, ease the burden on caregivers, or delay admission to a nursing home. Many researchers are also examining whether these drugs may be useful for treating other types of dementia. Many people with dementia, particularly those in the early stages, may benefit from practicing tasks designed to improve performance in specific aspects of cognitive functioning. For example, people can sometimes be taught to use memory aids, such as mnemonics, computerized recall devices, or note taking. Prognosis There are many disorders that can cause dementia. Some, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Huntington\u2019s disease, lead to a progressive loss of mental functions. But other types of dementia can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. People with moderate or advanced dementia typically need round-the-clock care and supervision to prevent them from harming themselves or others. They also may need assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, and dressing. ",

Approximately 1% of patients over the age of 65, 2% of patients over the age of 75, and 4% of patients over the age of 85 have aortic stenosis.  \nCalcific degenerative aortic stenosis is more common in males. \nIn North America and Europe, a linear relationship exists between the increase in the incidence of aortic stenosis and the increase in aging population."

        "input": "Importance: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in up to half of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The longitudinal effects of COVID-19-associated AKI on kidney function remain unknown. Objective: To compare the rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after hospital discharge between patients with and without COVID-19 who experienced in-hospital AKI. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 5 hospitals in Connecticut and Rhode Island from March 10 to August 31, 2020. Patients who were tested for COVID-19 and developed AKI were screened, and those who survived past discharge, did not require dialysis within 3 days of discharge, and had at least 1 outpatient creatinine level measurement following discharge were included. Exposures: Diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mixed-effects models were used to assess the association between COVID-19-associated AKI and eGFR slope after discharge. The secondary outcome was the time to AKI recovery for the subgroup of patients whose kidney function had not returned to the baseline level by discharge. Results: A total of 182 patients with COVID-19-associated AKI and 1430 patients with AKI not associated with COVID-19 were included. The population included 813 women (50.4%); median age was 69.7 years (interquartile range, 58.9-78.9 years). Patients with COVID-19-associated AKI were more likely to be Black (73 [40.1%] vs 225 [15.7%]) or Hispanic (40 [22%] vs 126 [8.8%]) and had fewer comorbidities than those without COVID-19 but similar rates of preexisting chronic kidney disease and hypertension. Patients with COVID-19-associated AKI had a greater decrease in eGFR in the unadjusted model (-11.3; 95% CI, -22.1 to -0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2/y; P = .04) and after adjusting for baseline comorbidities (-12.4; 95% CI, -23.7 to -1.2 mL/min/1.73 m2/y; P = .03). In the fully adjusted model controlling for comorbidities, peak creatinine level, and in-hospital dialysis requirement, the eGFR slope difference persisted (-14.0; 95% CI, -25.1 to -2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2/y; P = .01). In the subgroup of patients who had not achieved AKI recovery by discharge (n = 319), COVID-19-associated AKI was associated with decreased kidney recovery during outpatient follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.92). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of US patients who experienced in-hospital AKI, COVID-19-associated AKI was associated with a greater rate of eGFR decrease after discharge compared with AKI in patients without COVID-19, independent of underlying comorbidities or AKI severity. This eGFR trajectory may reinforce the importance of monitoring kidney function after AKI and studying interventions to limit kidney disease after COVID-19-associated AKI.",

Limited information is available quantifying the anxiety experienced by skin cancer patients from both healthcare and non-healthcare factors. Therefore, the present study sought to perform a retrospective cross-sectional review of the 2013\u20132018 cycles of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to determine the prevalence, at-risk groups, and predictive factors of skin cancer patient financial stress. Survey responses estimated that 11.45% (95% Cl 10.02\u201312.88%) of skin cancer patients experience problems paying medical bills, 20.34% (95% Cl 18.97\u201321.71%) of patients worry about the medical costs, 13.73% (95% Cl 12.55\u201314.91%) of patients worry about housing costs, and 37.48% (95% Cl 35.83\u201339.14%) of patients worry about money for retirement. Focusing on at-risk groups, black patients, uninsured patients, and patients with low incomes (< 200% poverty level) consistently experienced high rates of financial stress for each of the four measures. Multivariable logistic regression revealed low education, lack of insurance, and low income to be predictive of financial stress. These findings suggest that a considerable proportion of skin cancer patients experience financial stress related to both healthcare and non-healthcare factors. Where possible, the additional intricacy of treating patients at risk of high financial stress may be considered to optimize patient experience and outcomes.",

METHODS A cross-sectional survey study including a total of 502 patients (291 female; 211 male) receiving orthodontic treatment at a public or private clinic was conducted via a web-based questionnaire. RESULTS Of all participants, 70.1% (352) were between the ages of 12 and 18 and 77.1% (387) were treated in a public clinic. According to the results, 97.3% (372) of the patients in the public clinic and 71.1% (79) of the patients in the private clinics had not been able to continue their treatment for 2 months or longer. Most of the participants were concerned about extended treatment duration (349, 69.5%) during this period. While the most common problems in patients with fixed appliances were soft tissue irritation (230, 52.5%), bracket failure (142, 32.4%), gingival swelling (88, 20.1%), and pain (88, 20.1%); there were issues of new spaces between teeth (41, 64.1%), pain (37, 57.8%), and gingival swelling (29, 45.3%) among patients with removable appliances. CONCLUSION Most patient appointments were delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients experienced various problems with their treatment, and as a result, concerns about extended treatment duration increased. Therefore, orthodontists should pay more attention to teleorthodontics during the pandemic process.",

It is noted that in the process of assessing the scale of current problems there is a need for a detailed study of the content, types, factors, and ways of spreading threats / threats to socioeconomic security of Ukraine, which have long accumulated in the economic sphere. It is determined that the release of citizens from the branches of the national economy, suspended due to quarantine;reduction of household incomes and rising prices for goods that have no substitutes;reduction of aggregate supply and demand in case of loss of markets;increase in receivables of enterprises and the general deterioration of their financial condition. All countries, markets, businesses, firms and other economic institutions have somehow coped with the effects of the pandemic. This is easily explained by the relatively rapid integration into the world economy through international trade, financial flows and labor migration. Another factor of economic instability was the rapid expansion of services. Despite the growing importance for society and employment, services are most at risk of a pandemic. Sectors of the economy that were under strong pressure under the influence of the coronavirus crisis are highlighted. The macrofinancial indicators of Ukraine for 2018-2020 are analyzed. Thus, there is a stable growth of GDP (in actual prices) throughout the study period, which indicates an increase in domestic production capacity. In 2019, this figure increased by 111.7% compared to 2018, and in 2020 this figure showed an increase of 105.5%. The total amount of public and state-guaranteed debt will increase during 2018-2020. In 2019, the debt increased by UAH 6.05 billion, and in 2020 this figure increased by UAH 5.88 billion. But the ratio of public debt to GDP fluctuates. In 2018, this figure was 60.9%, in 2019 - 50.3%, and in 2020 - 60.8%. The recession could be particularly damaging for countries with the greatest potential for unrest and conflict. The authors developed a strategy for managing the country's economic security has been developed.",

In the recovery phases of the pandemic, non-urgent medical care is resumed, but there is a lack of guidance for restarting and safely conducting motility and function testing. Breath tests and insertion of manometry and pH-monitoring probes carry a risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread through droplet formation. METHODS: A panel of experts from the European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) evaluated emerging national and single-center recommendations to provide the best current evidence and a pragmatic approach to ensure the safe conduct of motility and function testing for both healthcare professionals and patients. RESULTS: At a general level, this involves evaluation of the urgency of the procedure, evaluation of the infectious risk associated with the patient, the investigation and the healthcare professional(s) involved, provision of the test planning and test units, education and training of staff, and use of personnel protection equipment. Additional guidance is provided for specific procedures such as esophageal manometry, pH monitoring, and breath tests.

Sustainability is the goal to be achieved starting from the UN\u2019s 2030 Agenda. Accessibility and safety are among the aspects that can translate this objective into the specific field: social, environmental and economic. Green and Safety School is a program of Calabria Region to finance the realization of Limited Traffic Zones around schools as traffic-free areas to increase sustainable mobility, by improving safety and accessibility, reducing environmental effects and transport costs. The program realizes an urban space by re-design the involved areas. Green and Safety School is a program of Regional Transportation Plan, related to urban areas for the development of integrated actions for pedestrian ones, limited traffic areas, zones 30, green zones and low emissions zones;the program would like to promote environmental and social regeneration of the road spaces. Starting from the Plan, Green and Safety School was programmed with financial resources and executed with the opening of a call in 2019 closed with 10 eligible projects and the signing of agreements. This paper describes Green and Safety School, as an experience of Calabria Region in the general framework of the implementation of the Plan in urban areas, linked to another regional program named Scuola Sicura. This last program aims to give a great impact on sustainable development according to school buildings policy by seismic adjustment intervention for the risk reduction. Green and Safety School program increases its importance in the Covid-19 emergency time, because it provides areas available to guarantee social distancing and, in this way, reducing the risk of infection in school. Around the world, the schools are usually in the urban centers characterized by traffic problems. Green and Safety School can apply in other territorial realities, and the experience of Calabria Region can provide suggestions for technicians and decision-makers. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Interviews were conducted between August 2008 and June 2010. The characteristics of 56 dairy farms with at least one confirmed case of BNP (thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia and/or typical findings in post-mortem examination and bone marrow histology) were compared with those of two sets of 50 control dairy farms each, with no history of BNP. The first set of 50 control farms was selected randomly from veterinary practices which had never observed a BNP case on the farms they serviced. The second set of 50 control farms was matched by the veterinary practices which had provided case farms. Two separate analyses were conducted: (1) case farms (n = 56) vs. randomly selected control farms (n = 50) and (2) case farms (n = 56) vs. a matched set of control farms (n = 50). All variables with p < 0.2 in the univariable analysis were included in stepwise logistic regression models. In the first analysis, only the use of PregSure(\u00ae) BVD vaccine was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 1292 (95% CI: 114\u201314707). In the second analysis, conditional logistic regression models did not converge, therefore non-conditional logistic regression models were conducted. In the non-conditional analysis five variables remained in the model, three of which were negatively associated with BNP: the use of vitamin E and selenium, the frequent use of mastitis tubes, and the use of stem growth regulators in grain production. The use of prophylactic measures (such as control of parasites or vaccination of calves against respiratory disease) was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 14.3 as well as the use of PregSure(\u00ae) BVD vaccine with an odds ratio of 426 (95% CI: 20\u20139095).",

Italy was one of the first Western countries who faced the health emergency and is one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic. The diffusion of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy has followed a peculiar spatial pattern, however the attention of the scientific community has so far focussed almost exclusively on the prediction of the evolution of the disease over time. METHODS: Official freely available data about the number of infected at the finest possible level of spatial areal aggregation (Italian provinces) are used to model the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level. An endemic-epidemic time-series mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the phenomenon. RESULTS: Three subcomponents characterize the fitted model. The first describes the transmission of the illness within provinces; the second accounts for the transmission between nearby provinces; the third is related to the evolution of the disease over time. At the local level, the provinces first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, the component accounting for the spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent for provinces that are strongly involved by contagions. Moreover, the proposed model provides good forecasts for the number of infections at local level while controlling for delayed reporting. CONCLUSIONS: A strong evidence is found that strict control measures implemented in some provinces efficiently break contagions and limit the spread to nearby areas. While containment policies may potentially be more effective if planned considering the peculiarities of local territories, the effective and homogeneous enforcement of control measures at national level is needed to prevent the disease control being delayed or missed as a whole.

The data show that initial local transmission was dominated by B.1.1 lineages, but the second wave in Ghana was overwhelmingly driven by the Alpha variant, which was detected in community cases from January 2021, with Eta also contributing to reported cases. Subsequently, an unheralded variant under monitoring, B.1.1.318, dominated transmission from April to June 2021 before being displaced by Delta (B.1.1.617) and Delta Plus (AY.*) variants, which were introduced into community transmission in May 2021 and have remained dominant to date. Mutational analysis indicated that variants that took hold in Ghana harboured transmission enhancing and immune escape spike substitutions. The apparent rapid viral evolution observed demonstrate the potential for emergence of novel variants with greater mutational fitness.",

The population was generally susceptible. However, reports on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were very limited. By sharing the clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 18 patients with COVID-19 during late pregnancy, we hoped to provide some references for obstetric treatment and management. Methods: : A total of 18 patients with COVID-19 treated in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, chest CT and pregnancy outcomes were performed for analysis. Results: : 1 . 18 cases of late pregnancy infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were delivered at 35 + 5 weeks to 41 weeks. According to the clinical classification of COVID-19, 1 case was mild type, 16 cases were ordinary type, and 1 case was severe type. 2 . According to Imaging examinations: 15 (83%) cases showed unilateral or bilateral pneumonia, 2 (11%) cases had pulmonary infection with pleural effusion, and 1 (6%) case had no abnormal imaging changes. 8 (44%) cases were positive and 10 (56%) cases were negative for nasopharyngeal-swab tests of SARS-CoV-2. 3. Among the 18 newborns, there were 3 (17%) premature infants, 1 (6%) case of mild asphyxia, 5 (28%) cases of bacterial pneumonia, 1 (6%) case of gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 (6%) case of necrotizing enteritis, 2 (11%) cases of hyperbilirubinemia and 1 (6%) case of diarrhea. All the newborns were negative for the first throat swab test of SARS-CoV-2 after birth. 4. Follow-up to Mar 7, 2020, no maternal and neonatal deaths occurred. Conclusions: : The majority of patients in late term pregnancy with COVID-19 were of ordinary type, and they less likely developed into critical pneumonia after early isolation and antiviral treatment. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not detected, but the proportion of neonatal bacterial pneumonia was higher than other neonatal diseases in newborns.",

Intranasal (IN) administration of pIC has recently been used to adjuvant influenza virus vaccines; however, the effects of IN pIC administration on pulmonary T cell responses remain unclear. Here we show that a single IN administered dose of dsRNA into mice induced local Th1 chemokine production in the lungs and airways, and generated a biphasic and sustained migration of T lymphocytes to the airways. Furthermore, IN pIC-induced chemokine production and T cell recruitment to the airways were interferon-\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR) signaling dependent. The effect of dsRNA on T cell recruitment to the airways was also dependent on the presence of high molecular weight (HMW) pIC, as a low molecular weight (LMW) pIC preparation known to only interact with TLR3 did not elicit the same effect on T cell migration to the airways, suggesting that the observed effects were dependent upon dsRNA recognition by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PPRs). IN pIC was additionally capable of stimulating low levels of T cell proliferation in the draining lymph nodes approximately 4\u20136 days after treatment that preceded a small population of de-novo T cells found in the airways by day 10. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the adjuvant effect of IN pIC that results in enhanced T cell proliferation and sustained T cell recruitment to the airways requires multiple PRRs and IFNAR signaling.",

Co-morbidities including hypertension and diabetes have been associated with increased morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality among COVID-19 patients. This retrospective study describes the clinical characteristics, disease severity, and outcomes among the patient population at a tertiary hospital in Kenya. METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study of COVID-19 patients who were admitted between March 2020 and December 2020 at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Data collected include patient demographic and baseline characteristics. Differences between patients who were known to have diabetes and hypertension during admission were compared for statistical significance. Difference between those who survived and those who died were also compared for statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 913 records of patients were studied with a mean age of 51.2 years (SD = 16.7), 66.5% were male and 80.8% were of African origin. History of diabetes, hypertension, and HIV status were at 27.3%, 33.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. At presentation, 33.1% (302/913) of patients had known hypertension by history, and following admission, this proportion increased to 37.7% (344/913). At presentation, 27.3% (249/913) of patients had known diabetes. During hospital stay, 20.8% (190) more patients were found to have diabetes, raising the overall percent to 48.1% (439/913). When comparing diabetes and hypertension at baseline versus at the end of admission, diabetes increased by 20.8% (p < 0.001) and hypertension by 4.6% (p = 0.049). HIV co-infection was 2.3%, and no patient had tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: This study showed a high incidence of co-morbidities in patients infected with COVID-19. Diabetes was most common, followed by hypertension. All patients admitted with COVID-19 infection should routinely be tested for diabetes with HbA1c and have regular blood pressure monitoring in order to diagnose occult diabetes and hypertension. Adverse outcomes were found in patients with these co-morbidities and should be monitored and treated appropriately.",

        "input": "PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of single-stage endovascular treatment in patients with severe extracranial large vessel stenosis and concomitant ipsilateral unruptured intracranial aneurysm. METHODS Hospital database was screened for patients who underwent single-stage endovascular treatment between February 2008 and June 2013 and seven patients were identified. The procedures included unilateral carotid artery stenting (CAS) (n=4), bilateral CAS (n=2), and proximal left subclavian artery stenting (n=1) along with ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm treatment (n=7). The mean internal carotid artery stenosis was 81.6% (range, 70%-95%), and the subclavian artery stenosis was 90%. All aneurysms were unruptured. The mean aneurysm diameter was 7.7 mm (range, 5-13 mm). The aneurysms were ipsilateral to the internal carotid artery stenosis (internal carotid artery aneurysm) in five patients, and in the anterior communicating artery in one patient. The patient with subclavian artery stenosis had a fenestration aneurysm in the proximal basilar artery. Stenting of the extracranial large vessel stenosis was performed before aneurysm treatment in all patients. In two patients who underwent bilateral CAS, the contralateral carotid artery stenosis, which had no aneurysm distally, was treated initially. RESULTS There were no procedure-related complications or technical failure. The mean clinical follow-up period was 18 months (range, 9-34 months). One patient who underwent unilateral CAS experienced contralateral transient ischemic attack during the clinical follow-up. There was no restenosis on six-month follow-up angiograms, and all aneurysms were adequately occluded. CONCLUSION A single-stage procedure appears to be feasible for treatment of patients with severe extracranial large vessel stenosis and concomitant ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm.",

However, Algeria is among the first countries affected since February 25, 2020. In order to benefit from its experience in the least affected countries, this study aims to describe the current situation of the epidemic and then retrospectively estimate its real burden. As a first part of the study, we described the indicators of the epidemic as; the cumulative and daily reported cases and deaths, and we computed the R0 evolution. Secondly, we used the New York City cases-fatality rate standardized by Algerian age structure, to retrospectively estimate the actual burden. We found that reported cases are in a clear diminution, but, the epidemic epicentre is moving from Blida to other cities. We noted a clear peak in daily cases-fatality from March 30, to April 17, 2020, Fig. 3, due to underestimating the actual infections of the first 25 days. Since May 8, 2020, the daily R0 is around one, Fig. 4. Moreover, we noticed 31% reduction of its mean value from 1,41 to 0,97 between the last two months. The Algerian Age-Standardized Infection Fatality Rate we found is 0,88%. Based on that, we demonstrated that only 1,5% of actual infections were detected and reported before March 30, and 20% after March 31, Fig. 5. Therefore, the actual infections burden is currently five times higher than reported. At the end, we found that at least 0,2 % of the population have been infected until May 27. Consequently, the acquired herd immunity to date is therefore not sufficient to avoid a second wave. We believe that, the under estimation of the actual burden of the epidemic is probably due to the lack of testing capacities, however, all the indicators show that the situation is currently controlled. This requires more vigilance for the next weeks during the gradual easing of the preventive measures.",

        "input": "Objective To report a preliminary experience of outpatient management of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through an innovative approach of healthcare delivery. Patients and Methods Patients evaluated at the Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19 Outpatient clinics (MMCOs) of San Raffaele University Hospital and Luigi Sacco University Hospital in Milan, Italy, from 1 October 2020 to 31 October 2021 were included. Patients were referred by general practitioners (GPs), Emergency Department (ED) physicians or hospital specialists (HS) in case of moderate COVID-19. A classification and regression tree (CART) model predicting ED referral by MMCO physicians was developed to aid GPs identify those deserving immediate ED admission. Cost-effectiveness analysis was also performed. Results A total of 660 patients were included. The majority (70%) was referred by GPs, 21% by the ED and 9% by HS. Patients referred by GPs had more severe disease as assessed by peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and interstitial involvement at lung ultrasound. Among them, 18% were addressed to the ED following MMCO assessment. CART analysis identified three independent predictors, namely home-measured SpO2, age and body mass index (BMI), that robustly divide patients into risk groups of COVID-19 severity. Home-measured SpO2 < 95% and BMI \u2265 33 Kg/m2 defined the high-risk group. The model yielded an accuracy (95% CI) of 83 (77\u201388)%. Outpatient management of COVID-19 patients allowed the national healthcare system to spare 1,490,422.05 \u20ac when compared with inpatient care. Conclusion Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 outpatient clinics were effective and sustainable in managing COVID-19 patients and allowed to alleviate pressure on EDs and hospital wards, favoring effort redirection toward non-COVID-19 patients.",

This qualitative study aimed to understand preferences and priorities in their interactions with providers. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 24 in-depth interviews with people who obtained abortions at a comprehensive reproductive health clinic or with support from a feminist accompaniment group in Buenos Aires and Neuqu\u00e9n, Argentina. We iteratively coded transcripts using a thematic analysis approach based on interpersonal domains present in current quality of care frameworks. RESULTS: Participants described high-quality abortion care as feeling acompa\u00f1amiento and contenci\u00f3n from their providers \u2013 terms that imply receiving kind, caring, compassionate and emotionally supportive care throughout their abortion. They described four key elements of interpersonal interactions: attentive communication from providers and accompaniers, clear and understandable information provision, non-judgmental support, and individualized options for pain management. CONCLUSIONS: People obtaining abortions in Argentina consistently identified receiving compassionate and supportive care throughout an abortion as a key aspect of care. The findings have implications for incorporating people\u2019s perspectives in the development of care guidelines, training of providers, and monitoring and improving of services. This is particularly important as the government of Argentina prepares to expand legal access to abortion.

        "input": " Schizophrenia Psychosis - schizophrenia Psychotic disorders - schizophrenia Summary Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that makes it hard to tell the difference between what is real and not real. It also makes it hard to think clearly, have normal emotional responses, and act normally in social situations. Causes Schizophrenia is a complex illness. Mental health experts are not sure what causes it. Genes may play a role. Schizophrenia occurs in just as many men as women. It usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it may begin later in life. In women, it tends to begin later and is a milder condition. Schizophrenia in children usually begins after age 5. Childhood schizophrenia is rare and can be hard to tell apart from other developmental problems, such as autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms Symptoms usually develop slowly over months or years. The person may have many symptoms, or only a few. People with schizophrenia may have trouble keeping friends and working. They may also have problems with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Early symptoms may include: Irritable or tense feelings Trouble concentrating Trouble sleeping As the illness continues, the person may have problems with thinking, emotions, and behavior, including: Hearing or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations) Isolation Reduced emotions in tone of voice or expression of face Problems with understanding and making decisions Problems paying attention and following through with activities Strongly held beliefs that are not real (delusions) Talking in a way that does not make sense Thoughts that \"jump\" between different topics (loose associations) Exams and Tests There are no medical tests to diagnose schizophrenia. A psychiatrist should examine the person and make the diagnosis. The diagnosis is made based on an interview of the person and family members. The psychiatrist will ask about the following: How long symptoms have lasted How the person's ability to function has changed What the person's developmental background was like About the person's genetic and family history How well medicines have worked Whether the person has problems with substance abuse Other medical conditions the person has Brain scans (such as CT or MRI) and blood tests may help rule out other conditions that have similar symptoms. Treatment During an episode of schizophrenia, the person may need to stay in the hospital for safety reasons. MEDICINES Antipsychotic drugs are the most effective treatment for schizophrenia. They change the balance of chemicals in the brain and can help control symptoms. These drugs can cause side effects, but many side effects can be managed. Side effects should not prevent the person from getting treated for this serious condition. Common side effects from antipsychotics may include: Dizziness Feelings of restlessness or jitteriness Sleepiness (sedation) Slowed movements Tremor Weight gain Long-term use of antipsychotics may increase the risk of a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia. This condition causes repeated movements that the person cannot control. Call the health care provider right away if you think you or your family member may have this condition due to the medicine. When schizophrenia does not improve with antipsychotics, other medicines may be tried. Schizophrenia is a life-long illness. Most people with this condition need to stay on antipsychotics for life. SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND THERAPIES Support therapy may be helpful for many people with schizophrenia. Behavioral techniques, such as social skills training, can help the person function better in social and work situations. Job training and relationship-building classes are also important. Family members and caregivers are very important during treatment. Therapy can teach important skills, such as: Coping with symptoms that continue, even while taking medicines Following a healthy lifestyle, including getting enough sleep and staying away from recreational drugs Taking medicines correctly and managing side effects Watching for the return of symptoms, and knowing what to do when they return Getting the right support services Outlook (Prognosis) Outlook is hard to predict. Most of the time, symptoms improve with medicines. But many people may have trouble functioning. They are at risk of repeated episodes, especially during the early stages of the illness. People with schizophrenia may need housing, job training, and other community support programs. Those with the most severe forms of this disorder may not be able to live alone. They may need to live in group homes or other long-term, structured residences. Symptoms are very likely to return when medicine is stopped. Possible Complications Having schizophrenia increases the risk of: Developing a problem with alcohol or drugs. Using these substances increases the chances that symptoms will return. Physical illness. This is due to an inactive lifestyle and side effects of medicines. Suicide. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you (or a family member): Hear voices telling you to hurt yourself or others Have the urge to hurt yourself or others Feel scared or overwhelmed See things that are not really there Feel that you cannot leave the house Feel that you are not able to care for yourself Prevention Schizophrenia cannot be prevented. Symptoms may be prevented by taking medicine exactly as the doctor instructed. Symptoms are likely to return if medicine is stopped. Changing or stopping medicines should only be done by the doctor who prescribed them. Review Date 8/14/2017 Updated by: Fred K. Berger, MD, addiction and forensic psychiatrist, Scripps Memorial Hospital, La Jolla, CA.

As of yet, studies have only provided insights from researchers or industry experts detailing perceived consequences, or from survey data indicating modifications in angler activity levels and behaviours. Using real recreational fisheries data from an ongoing radio telemetry study (2018\u2013present), we explored changes in the relative exploitation rates of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; Walbaum 1792) in the Saugeen River, Ontario, a tributary to Lake Huron, before compared to during the pandemic. Restrictions on site access that affected the implementation of important management activities that usually support this popular fishery are also discussed. During the initial phase of complete public lock-downs imposed during spring 2020, angler exploitation rates decreased to half that reported prior to the pandemic. Fishway operations were temporarily suspended and hatchery efforts were interrupted. Once restrictions began to ease in fall 2020, there was an eight-fold increase in overall exploitation rate and a four and a half-fold increase in harvest rate compared to seasons prior to the pandemic. While the full impact of the ongoing pandemic on the Lake Huron fishery is not likely to be fully realized for several years, the potential effects on future return run sizes may need to be considered by fisheries managers monitoring trends in population escapement.",

Patients\u2019 satisfaction and physicians\u2019 assessment of the cosmetic outcome were not inferior for previously irradiated compared to non-irradiated breasts. These results are encouraging and support continuing research as well as a discussion of risk-reduction alternatives besides mastectomy, including prophylactic breast irradiation, in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. ABSTRACT: Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) is often advocated for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who face a heightened lifetime risk of breast cancer. However, many carrier patients seek alternative risk-reducing measures. In a phase II nonrandomized trial, we previously reported that prophylactic irradiation to the contralateral breast among BRCA carriers undergoing breast-conserving treatment significantly reduced subsequent contralateral breast cancer. Herein, we report the outcome of salvage mastectomy and reconstruction in 11 patients that suffered reoccurrences of breast cancer in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast or elected to have the procedure for risk reduction during the eight-year follow-up period. Patients\u2019 satisfaction with the procedure and physicians\u2019 assessment of the cosmetic outcome were not inferior for previously irradiated compared to non-irradiated breasts. Although the numbers are small, the results are encouraging and sustain hope in a challenging population. Our findings support continuing research as well as a discussion of risk-reduction alternatives besides mastectomy, including prophylactic breast irradiation, in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",

The objective of this study is to determine whether SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was present in resected specimens from patients with acute bowel ischemia, but asymptomatic for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) and with persistently real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction negative pharyngeal swab. METHODS: Three consecutive patients presented severe abdominal symptoms due to extensive ischemia and necrosis of the bowel, with co\u2010existent thrombosis of abdominal blood vessels. None had the usual manifestations of COVID\u201019, and repeated pharyngeal swabs tested negative. They underwent emergency surgery with intestinal resection. Immunohistochemical testing for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 on resected tissue was performed. RESULTS: All tested samples were strongly positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report in which patients with severe intestinal symptoms presented a marked SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positivity in the resected tissues, without any usual clinical manifestations of COVID\u201019.

I was prescribed Naproxen, a muscle relaxant, and physical therapy. I went to physical therapy and everything seemed to go okay. I mean, it didn t hurt any more than when I wasn t there. About 4 hours afterwards though, I had worse pain than when I first was seen. I was then seen the next day and the physician ordered an MRI of my cervical spine in search of a herniated disc pinching a nerve. From the first time I was seen until now, my pain has increased, but also I have had numbness, weakness, and pins and needles or tingly feeling in my arm and hand. The MRI came back negative for a herniated disc, so I was told I could return to work with a lifting restriction of 10 lbs and also no pulling, pushing, or reaching my arm above my head. Today was my first day back to work and I was placed in a part of the hospital making phone calls all day to accommodate my lifting restriction.

Dutch professionals are concerned about the mental consequences, and in particular that during and after hospitalization little attention is paid to psychological problems. AIM To monitor the short-term course and severity of (neuro)psychiatric symptoms after hospitalization for COVID-19. To make a recommendation regarding whether or not to follow-up these patients psychiatrically to optimize care. METHOD In an observational cohort-study screening questions and additional questionnaires were used during two follow-up contacts to monitor cognition (MoCA), affective symptoms (HADS and IES) and overall functioning. RESULTS More than half of the 29 included patients showed (neuro)psychiatric problems at both follow-up moments. Two weeks after discharge, we mainly saw symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Except for complaints related to the traumatic experience of the COVID-19, these seemed to have a favorable natural course. A negative time effect was seen for complaints consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. Two months after discharge limitations in cognition and overall functioning appeared to be the main complaints after COVID-19. CONCLUSION (Neuro)psychiatric symptoms after a COVID-19 are common. The natural course for affective complaints is more favorable than for cognitive functions. Specialist follow-up of patients with post-COVID psychological problems is recommended.",

Methods: Through the China's Infectious Disease Information System, we collected deaths\u2019 information in Wuhan. We analyzed the patient's demographic characteristics, drew epidemiological curve, made distribution map of epidemic situation, etc. @Risk for fitting distribution, SPSS for statistical analysis, and ArcGIS for mapping. Results: As of February 24, 2020, a total of 1833 unique deaths were extracted. Among the deaths with COVID-19, the mild type accounted for the most, 37.2%, followed by severe type, 30.1%. The median age was 70.0 (inter quartile range: 63.0-79.0) years, most of the deaths were distributed in 50-89 age group;no deaths occurred in 0-9 age group;and the male to female ratio was 1.95. A total of 65.7% of the deaths in Wuhan combined with underlying diseases, and the deaths with underlying diseases were mainly male;the main combined underlying diseases were hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The peak of daily deaths appeared on February 14 and then declined after February 14. The median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was 10.0 (6.0-14.0) days;the interval from onset to diagnosis gradually shortened. The median interval from diagnosis to death was 6.0 (2.0-11.0)days;The median interval from symptom onset to deaths was 17.0 (12.0-22.0)days, respectively. In terms of geographical distribution, the central urban area was more serious. Wuchang District had the highest number of deaths, and Jianghan District had the highest death rate. Conclusion: COVID-19 posed a greater threat to the elderly and more men than women, especially elderly men with underlying diseases. The geographical distribution showed that the epidemic in the central area of Wuhan is more serious than in the surrounding areas. Analysis of deaths as of February 24 indicates that the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan has achieved a tremendous improvement, and the strong epidemic control measures taken by Wuhan Government were very effective.",

However, the immunogenicity of RBD monomers is not strong enough. In this study, we fused the RBD-monomer with a modified Fc fragment of human IgG1 to form an RBD-Fc fusion protein. The recombinant vaccine candidate based on the RBD-Fc protein could induce high levels of IgG and neutralizing antibody in mice, and these could last for at least three months. The secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-10 in the RBD-stimulated splenocytes of immunized mice also increased significantly. Our results first showed that the RBD-Fc vaccine could induce both humoral and cellular immune responses and might be an optional strategy to control COVID-19.",

This relationship has only been marginally considered in the German literature so far. The prioritized aim of the present study was to investigate a correlative and factorial relationship between alexithymia and expressive suppression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 317 persons participated in an online survey. Data on alexithymia and expressive suppression were collected using the German versions of the Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-26) and the emotion regulation questionnaire (ERQ). RESULTS: The results showed highly significant correlations between the TAS-26 subscale \u201cdifficulty in identifying feelings\u201d and the ERQ scale \u201csuppression\u201d (r = 0.5; p < 0.001) and between the TAS-26 subscale \u201cdifficulty in describing feelings\u201d and the ERQ scale \u201csuppression\u201d (r = 0.64; p < 0.001). The results of an exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor solution with common factor for the TAS-26 subscales \u201cdifficulty in identifying feelings\u201d and \u201cdifficulty in describing feelings\u201d and the ERQ scale \u201csuppression\u201d with a common variance of 38.2% (\u03c7(2) = 363.843, p < 0.001, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, KMO, value = 0.699). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the TAS-26 scales in the components \u201cdifficulty in identifying feelings\u201d and \u201cdifficulty in describing feelings\u201d and the ERQ scale \u201csuppression\u201d in the component of \u201cexpressive suppression\u201d have a common construct, which is referred to with the term speechlessness.",

Wheezing during HRV infection in early life identifies children at particularly high-risk of asthma development. Plausible mechanisms by which HRV could cause airway damage, promote airway remodeling, and lead to asthma development have recently been identified. SUMMARY HRV is a significant source of morbidity in infants and young children. The present review identifies mechanisms by which HRV lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in a susceptible host, could promote the development of childhood asthma. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the link between HRV wheezing in early childhood and subsequent asthma development, with the critical goal of identifying novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for both early childhood wheezing and asthma.",

Although it is possible that quarantine for the current COVID-19 pandemic affects migraine burden, no information is currently available on this i AIM: In this study, we aimed: a) to explore the effect of quarantine on migraine frequency, severity and days with acute medication intake, and b) to evaluate whether migraine, changes in lifestyle, and emotions. were affected in a different manner in three geographic Italian areas with diverse COVID-19 diffusion, METHODS We interviewed patients included in the observational Italian registry of headache (Registro Italiano Cefalee, RICe), retrospectively collecting information on main headache features, lifestyles factors, emotions, individual infection status, and perception for COVID-19 for the two months before quarantine and during quarantine. Inclusion criteria were: age > 18;diagnosis of migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and chronic migraine;last in-person visit in the 3 months before the beginning of the quarantine. RESULTS A total of 433 migraine subjects agreed to be interviewed. We found an overall reduction in headache frequency and days with acute medication intake during the quarantine as compared to pre-quarantine. Reduction in headache frequency prevailed in patients reported more days of effective staying at home. Improvement was not evident in northern Italy. Disgust against viral infection corresponded to a reduced improvement in migraine parameters. CONCLUSIONS. Migraine patients showed a resilient behavior toward the pandemic distress. Disgust against the contagious disease, could increase migraine frequency. ssue.",

Wearing mouth-and-nose protection has been made a mandate in many public places, to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. However, face masks affect the performance of face recognition, since a large area of the face is covered. The effect of wearing a face mask on the different components of the face recognition system in a collaborative environment is a problem that is still to be fully studied. This work studies, for the first time, the effect of wearing a face mask on face image quality by utilising state-of-the-art face image quality assessment methods of different natures. This aims at providing better understanding on the effect of face masks on the operation of face recognition as a whole system. In addition, we further studied the effect of simulated masks on face image utility in comparison to real face masks. We discuss the correlation between the mask effect on face image quality and that on the face verification performance by automatic systems and human experts, indicating a consistent trend between both factors. The evaluation is conducted on the database containing (1) no-masked faces, (2) real face masks, and (3) simulated face masks, by synthetically generating digital facial masks on no-masked faces according to the NIST protocols [1, 23]. Finally, a visual interpretation of the face areas contributing to the quality score of a selected set of quality assessment methods is provided to give a deeper insight into the difference of network decisions in masked and non-masked faces, among other variations.",

In the field of biology, even if the agent is identified, knowledge of the routes of contamination (airborne, cutaneous, etc.) is limited in the case of emerging agents (SARS-CoV-2 type). As a result, the means of protection are often over or undersized at the outset, either because of a lack of knowledge of the risk or because of a lack of knowledge of the capacities of the means of protection itself. Most of the professions associated with a particular risk are equipped with specific Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (Military, Fire Brigade, Industry, Agriculture\u2026) adapted to their own constraints. In the field of health, the supply of PPE is often, with a few exceptions, derived directly from industry or military equipment (protective clothing against chemical risks, for example), but the specific \u201chealth\u201d constraints are rarely considered, often resulting in the unsuitability of the latter. PPE legislation is complex and we will summarise the main principles. Two concepts clash and sometimes complement each other between watertight and filtering type of clothing. In the light of hospital and humanitarian experiences, we will try to highlight the essential characteristics that could define our outfits of tomorrow.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND Three-dimensional (3D) laparoscopy improves the surgical skills of novice surgeons and positively affects the learning curve in experimental settings. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 3D passive polarizing display (3DPPD) and a novel 3D head-mounted display (3DHMD; HMS-3000MT) on the performance of the first laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair by novices and compare both systems with standard high-definition 2D (HD2D) laparoscopy. METHODS Patients with symptomatic inguinal hernia underwent transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach hernia repair using 3DHMD, 3DPPD, or a conventional HD2D laparoscopic system. All surgeries were performed for the first time by three laparoscopically novice surgeons. Operative performance was compared in terms of the time taken for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing under standardized conditions. Additionally, visual perception parameters and adverse effects were assessed. RESULTS The use of both 3D techniques shortened the time required for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing compared with the conventional HD2D approach. Generally, 3D laparoscopy was superior to HD2D laparoscopy in terms of visual perception parameters such as depth perception, sharpness, ghosting, and contrast. However, compared with the use of HD2D laparoscopy, the use of 3DHMD significantly impaired a surgeon's comfort, with the greatest impairment caused by ear discomfort, headaches, and facial and physical discomforts. CONCLUSIONS The 3DHMD and 3DPPD systems showed clear improvement in first hernia repair laparoscopy by novice surgeons in terms of surgical performance, as well as visual perception; however, the 3DHMD system was not superior to the 3DPPD system. The reduction in training time for new surgeons is obviously advantageous. In this respect, the 3D equipment may be a worthwhile investment.",

This study aimed to investigate the trends of incidence and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 in the world by April 30, 2020. METHODS: This was a descriptive-analytical study. We investigated the number of cases and deaths in 35 selected countries and regions of the WHO that had at least 10,000 cases by the time of the study. In addition, the incidence and CFR of COVID-19 were investigated. Finally, time trends of the number of cases, deaths, and CFR were investigated using ordinary least squares regression models. RESULTS: The total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 3,090,184. The European region had the highest number of COVID-19 patients (1,434,649 [46.43%]). Ukraine with 10,406 and the USA with 1,003,974 cases have reported the lowest and highest confirmed cases, respectively. In addition, the European region and the African region with 157.13 and 2.50 patients per 100,000 population had the highest and the lowest incidence rate, respectively. India (2.44) and Spain (455.69) had the lowest and the highest incidence rate per 100,000 population, respectively. In the world, 217,759 deaths have happened, of which 135,961 (62.44%) were reported in the European region. Furthermore, the USA had the highest number of deaths (52,428) due to COVID-19. CFR was 7.05% in the world, which ranged from 3.74% in the African region and 9.48% in the European region. The number of patients and deaths due to COVID-19 had increasing trends in all countries, and the trend of CFR just for Iran and Ukraine was negative. CONCLUSION: The countries had different trends in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. However, regarding the increasing trend of the disease in the world, it will be more important to rely on public prevention strategies. It is necessary to apply and continue public health policies at national and global levels till the control of the disease.",

This study aimed to evaluate the presence of virus in non-airborne body fluids as transmission vehicles. Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from December 01, 2019, to July 01, 2020, using terms relating to SARS-CoV-2 and non-airborne clinical sample sources (feces, urine, blood, serum, serum, and peritoneum). Studies in humans, of any design, were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 2 tool. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used for abstracting data. If \u22655 studies reported proportions for the same non-respiratory site, a meta-analysis was conducted using either a fixed or random-effects model, depending on the presence of heterogeneity. A total of 22 studies with 648 patients were included. Most were cross-sectional and cohort studies. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was most frequently detected in feces. Detectable RNA was reported in 17% of the blood samples, 8% of the serum, 16% in the semen, but rarely in urine. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in non-airborne sites varies widely with a third of non-airborne fluids. Patients with bowel and non-specific symptoms have persistence of virus in feces for upto 2 weeks after symptom resolution. Although there was a very low detection rate in urine, given the more frequent prevalence in blood samples, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with disrupted urothelium or undergoing urinary tract procedures, is likely to be higher. Healthcare providers need to consider non-airborne transmission and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in body fluids to enable appropriate precautions to protect healthcare workers and carers.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To assess whether vaginal secretions and breast milk of women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). DESIGN: Single centre cohort study. SETTING: Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei province, China. POPULATION: We studied 13 SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women diagnosed between 31 January and 9 March 2020. METHODS: We collected clinical data, vaginal secretions, stool specimens and breast milk from SARS-CoV-2-infected women during different stages of pregnancy and collected neonatal throat and anal swabs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed viral presence in different biosamples. RESULTS: Of the 13 women with COVID-19, five were in their first trimester, three in their second trimester and five in their third trimester. Of the five women in their third trimester who gave birth, all delivered live newborns. Among these five deliveries, the primary adverse perinatal outcomes included premature delivery (n = 2) and neonatal pneumonia (n = 2). One of nine stool samples was positive; all 13 vaginal secretion samples, and five throat swabs and four anal swabs collected from neonates, were negative for the novel coronavirus. However, one of three samples of breast milk was positive by viral nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 13 pregnant women with COVID-19, we observed negative viral test results in vaginal secretion specimens, suggesting that a vaginal delivery may be a safe delivery option. However, additional research is urgently needed to examine breast milk and the potential risk for viral contamination. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: New evidence for the safety of vaginal delivery and breastfeeding in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, positive viral result in a breast-milk sample.",

        "input": "Correct interpretation of tumor progression data, including the influence of host biology, in mouse models of breast cancer requires models and conditions that faithfully recapitulate human disease and human host status. Our previous attempts to investigate the effects of social isolation have proven inconclusive due to premature mortality in tumor-bearing animals. Those studies were completed in standard temperature (ST), which commonly is 70-72\u00b0F (21-22\u00b0C) for in vivo murine research based on laboratory animal care and use guidelines. Previous work from the Repasky lab (Kokulus, 2013), which we have validated (Gaymon, 2020), demonstrates that ST housing results in chronic cold stress and immune suppression mediated by an increase in norepinrephrine (NE) levels, leading to increased tumor aggressiveness. Based on these findings, we investigated the effects of social isolation on BALB/cJ-4T1-luc and C57BL/6J/E0771 tumor progression and metastasis in thermoneutral housing conditions (84-85\u00b0F). Mice were first acclimatized to thermoneutral temperature and/or isolation for two weeks in cages that were unilaterally draped to provide physical and visual isolation. In BALB/cJ mice, 4T1-luc tumors were significantly larger in isolated mice compared to group-housed (GH) mice at day 18 (p<.0001). Statistically larger tumors were observed in isolated mice compared to GH mice through day 24 and final tumor masses were Salso significantly different (p=.004). Spleen masses were not statistically different. In C57BL/6J mice, E0771 tumors were significantly larger in isolates at Day 25 (p=.002). Final tumor masses were statistically (p=.002) different while no difference in spleen sizes were observed. Data on metastasis will be presented at the meeting. We hypothesized that social isolation may perturb immune function and next investigated the growth of 4T1-luc xenograft tumors in NSG mice. 4T1-luc/NSG tumor progression and metastasis data will also be presented at the meeting. We conclude that syngeneic breast tumor growth in immunocompetent BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J mice demonstrates that social isolation is a bona fide stress with sufficient influence to exacerbate breast cancer growth. These data are potentially clinically important due the known relationship of social support to survivorship outcomes in patients and the high-risk of depression and isolation in patients following breast cancer diagnosis. The data may provide additional insight into possible effects of COVID-19 isolation on breast cancer progression.",

The correlations between entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students, IEE in colleges, IPE, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy are analyzed with the Spearman correlation and linear regression. The hierarchical regression analysis is used to analyze the intermediary role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in IEE, IPE in colleges, and entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students. The results show that the entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students is significantly different in gender, family location, and grade level (p < 0.05); the main channels of IPE and daily IPE have significant positive effects on the positive entrepreneurship psychological quality (p < 0.05), and have extremely significant positive effects on the entrepreneurial self-efficacy (p < 0.001); innovation and entrepreneurship course, innovation and entrepreneurship practices, innovation and entrepreneurship environment, and total score of IEE have significant positive correlations with positive entrepreneurship psychological quality and entrepreneurial self-efficacy of college students (p < 0.05); and the intermediary effect of entrepreneurial self-efficacy accounts for 33.49% on the IPE and entrepreneurial psychological quality, and 41.85% on IEE and entrepreneurial psychological quality. In short, IPE and IEE can effectively improve the positive psychological quality and self-efficacy of college students, and the joint construction of the two can have a more significant effect.",

Previous studies have proven that deep learning algorithms can be utilized to aid in the diagnosis of patients with potential COVID-19 infection. However, the accuracy of current COVID-19 recognition models is relatively low. Motivated by this fact, we propose three deep learning architectures, F-EDNC, FC-EDNC, and O-EDNC, to quickly and accurately detect COVID-19 infections from chest computed tomography (CT) images. Sixteen deep learning neural networks have been modified and trained to recognize COVID-19 patients using transfer learning and 2458 CT chest images. The proposed EDNC has then been developed using three of sixteen modified pre-trained models to improve the performance of COVID-19 recognition. The results suggested that the F-EDNC method significantly enhanced the recognition of COVID-19 infections with 97.75% accuracy, followed by FC-EDNC and O-EDNC (97.55% and 96.12%, respectively), which is superior to most of the current COVID-19 recognition models. Furthermore, a localhost web application has been built that enables users to easily upload their chest CT scans and obtain their COVID-19 results automatically. This accurate, fast, and automatic COVID-19 recognition system will relieve the stress of medical professionals for screening COVID-19 infections.",

At the same time, Hispanic women remain considerably underrepresented in behavioral weight loss interventions. The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the evidence related to the effectiveness of weight loss interventions among Hispanic women in the U.S. This review will identify elements of successful weight loss interventions as well as areas for future research. METHODS/DESIGN The following databases will be searched to identify all relevant articles (from inception onwards): PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Chicano Database, SPORTDiscus, CAB Abstracts, and Google Scholar. We will include randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies of adult women (> 18 years) from Hispanic/Latino background living in the United States. Eligible interventions will target weight-related behaviors (including diet, physical activity, behavior modification and/or their combinations). The review's primary outcome will be weight change (expressed as change in lbs/kg or body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2)). Three reviewers will independently screen and select data and two will extract data. The methodological quality (or risk of bias) of individual studies will be appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. A narrative synthesis will describe quality and content of the evidence. DISCUSSION The aim of this systematic review is to critically examine existing weight loss interventions for Hispanic women in the U.S. and provide quality evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions on weight loss. Further, this review seeks to identify characteristics of effective interventions and suggest future directions for research efforts targeting weight loss in this population.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic imposes major challenges for care of cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the effects of the pandemic on treatment and appointments of patients with malignant melanoma based on a large skin cancer centre in Berlin, Germany, and identify reasons for, and impact factors associated with these changes. MATERIALS & METHODS: Patients with melanoma treated from January 1(st) 2019 received a postal survey with questions on impairment due to the pandemic, fear of COVID-19, fear of melanoma, changes in therapy and/or appointments, including reasons for the changes. Impact factors on postponed/missed appointments were examined using descriptive analyses and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The response rate was 41.3% (n = 324; 57.4% males; mean age: 67.9 years). Among 104 participants currently receiving therapy, four (3.8%) reported treatment changes due to the pandemic. Postponements or cancellations of appointments occurred in 48 participants (14.8%), most frequently, at their own request (81.3%) due to fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection (68.8%). Current treatment was associated with a reduced chance of postponing/missing appointments (OR = 0.208, p = 0.003), whereas a high or very high level of concern for COVID-19 (OR = 6.806, p = 0.034; OR = 10.097, p = 0.038), SARS-CoV-2 infection among close acquaintances (OR = 4.251, p = 0.026), anxiety disorder (OR = 5.465, p = 0.016) and AJCC stage IV (OR = 3.108, p = 0.048) were associated with a higher likelihood of postponing/missing appointments. CONCLUSION: Among our participants, treatment changes were rare and the proportion of missed/delayed appointments was rather small. The main reasons for delays/cancellations of appointments were anxiety and concern for COVID-19.

METHOD: We searched PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. We selected randomized trials, observational studies, case series or case reports, and research letters of children ages birth to 18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to calculate the weighted mean prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) or the weighted average means and 95% CI. RESULT: Forty-six articles reporting 551 cases of COVID-19 in children (aged 1 day-17.5 years) were included. Eighty-seven percent (95% CI: 77%-95%) of patients had household exposure to COVID-19. The most common symptoms and signs were fever (53%, 95% CI: 45%-61%), cough (39%, 95% CI: 30%-47%), and sore throat/pharyngeal erythema (14%, 95% CI: 4%-28%); however, 18% (95% CI: 11%-27%) of cases were asymptomatic. The most common radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings were patchy consolidations (33%, 95% CI: 23%-43%) and ground glass opacities (28%, 95% CI: 18%-39%), but 36% (95% CI: 28%-45%) of patients had normal CT images. Antiviral agents were given to 74% of patients (95% CI: 52%-92%). Six patients, all with major underlying medical conditions, needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and one of them died. CONCLUSION: Previously healthy children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms. The diagnosis is generally suspected from history of household exposure to COVID-19 case. Children with COVID-19 and major underlying condition are more likely to have severe/critical disease and poor prognosis, even death.",

The mean aminopeptidase activity in synovial fluids from RA patients was significantly higher than from patients with osteoarthritis. The mean value of serum aminopeptidase activity was significantly higher in patients with SLE, RA, SSc, and PM/DM than in normal subjects.

Recent mounting evidence suggests that KLKs also represent important regulators of viral infections. It is well-established that certain enveloped viruses, including influenza and coronaviruses, require proteolytic processing of their hemagglutinin or spike proteins, respectively, to infect host cells. Similarly, the capsid protein of the non-enveloped papillomavirus L1 should be proteolytically cleaved for viral uncoating. Consequently, extracellular or membrane-bound proteases of the host cells are instrumental for viral infections and represent potential targets for drug development. Here, we summarize how extracellular proteolysis mediated by the kallikreins is implicated in the process of influenza (and potentially coronavirus and papillomavirus) entry into host cells. Besides direct proteolytic activation of viruses, KLK5 and 12 promote viral entry indirectly through proteolytic cascade events, like the activation of thrombolytic enzymes that also can process hemagglutinin, while additional functions of KLKs in infection cannot be excluded. In the light of recent evidence, KLKs represent potential host targets for the development of new antivirals. Humanized animal models to validate their key functions in viral infections will be valuable.",

Unlike atopic asthma, control of AE is seldom assessed in therapeutics. AIM: To investigate the utility of a Traffic Light Control (TLC) system as a measurement/assessment of self-perceived eczema control. METHODS: This is a prospectively study of all Chinese children (aged 6 to 18 years old) with eczema attending the paediatric dermatology clinic of a tertiary hospital from Jan to June 2020. Eczema control, eczema severity, quality of life and biophysical skin condition of consecutive patients at the paediatric dermatology clinic of a teaching hospital were evaluated with the validated Chinese versions of Depressive, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS-21), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and stratum corneum skin hydration (SH), respectively. With a visual TLC analogy, patients were asked if their eczema is under control (green light), worsening (yellow) or in flare-up (red light). RESULTS: Among AE patients (n = 36), self-perceived TLC as green (under control), amber (worsening) and red (flare up) reflected acute and chronic severity (SCORAD, NESS, POEM) and quality of life (CDLQI) (p< 0.0001), but not SH, TEWL or Depression, anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS: Eczema control can be semi-quantified with a child-friendly TLC self-assessment system. AE patients reporting worse eczema control have worse acute and chronic eczema severity, more impairment of quality of life; but not the psychologic symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress or skin hydration or transepidermal water loss. TLC can be linked to an eczema action plan to guide patient management.",

Despite the plant\u2019s known immune modulatory potential and chemical make-up, scientific information on its antiviral properties and mode of action have not been completely investigated. In this study, the broad antiviral spectrum and mode of action of an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai was evaluated in vitro, and moreover, the protective effect against divergent influenza A subtypes was determined in BALB/c mice. An effective dose of Epimedium koreanum Nakaimarkedly reduced the replication of Influenza A Virus (PR8), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) in RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells. Mechanically, we found that an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the secretion of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent stimulation of the antiviral state in cells. Among various components present in the extract, quercetin was confirmed to have striking antiviral properties. The oral administration of Epimedium koreanum Nakai exhibited preventive effects on BALB/c mice against lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H7N3 and H9N2). Therefore, an extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai and its components play roles as immunomodulators in the innate immune response, and may be potential candidates for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against diverse viruses in animal and humans.",

        "input": "More than 10 million people are thought to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, primarily in the Americas. The clinical manifestations of Chagas' disease (CD) are variable, but most subjects remain asymptomatic for decades. Only 15 to 30% eventually develop terminal complications. All current diagnostic tests have limitations. New approaches are needed for blood bank screening as well as for improved diagnosis and prognosis. Sera from subjects with asymptomatic CD (n = 131) were compared to those from uninfected controls (n = 164) and subjects with other parasitic diseases (n = 140), using protein array mass spectrometry. To identify biomarkers associated with CD, sera were fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography and bound to two commercial ProteinChip array chemistries: WCX2 and IMAC3. Multiple candidate biomarkers were found in CD sera (3 to 75.4 kDa). Algorithms employing 3 to 5 of these biomarkers achieved up to 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity for CD. The biomarkers most useful for diagnosis were identified and validated. These included MIP1 alpha, C3a anaphylatoxin, and unusually truncated forms of fibronectin, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and C3. An antipeptide antiserum against the 28.9-kDa C terminus of the fibronectin fragment achieved good specificity (90%) for CD in a Western blot format. We identified full-length ApoA1 (28.1 kDa), the major structural and functional protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), as an important negative biomarker for CD, and relatively little full-length ApoA1 was detected in CD sera. This work provides proof of principle that both platform-dependent (i.e., mass spectrometry-based) and platform-independent (i.e., Western blot) tests can be generated using high-throughput mass profiling.",

Hilton\u2019s analysis of the findings of these studies indicated two major findings: (1) when students use OER, they obtain the same learning outcomes as with traditional textbooks while saving money; and (2) both students and teachers find OER comparable to traditional learning resources in terms of quality. Several advantages of OER were also revealed. These included low or no cost of OER, perceived ease of reading and access, their ability to provide the same learning outcomes as traditional materials, and students\u2019 and instructors\u2019 positive perceptions. By indicating the role of OER in obtaining the same or similar learning, the study has also suggested that OER be considered useful sources for classes and also a valid replacement for commercial textbooks. However, we also need to consider the context where OER will be used and how OER are designed and used in this context since these two determine whether OER will work and suffice.

A search of bibliographic databases (WoS, Scopus, Medline) found numerous studies published in various publications by entering the keywords: COVID-19 OR pandemic AND psychological needs AND mental health AND hardiness. The results of the research indicated that the fear of infecting oneself and loved ones, the consequences of social distancing and the economic consequences of a pandemic could have a significant effect on mental health. The following groups have been identified as particularly vulnerable to pandemic stressors: (a) people who have been in direct or indirect contact with the virus;(b) people with previous psychiatric problems;(c) health professionals and (d) people who constantly follow pandemic news. The consequences of a pandemic threaten basic psychological needs such as physiological needs, the need for safety, and the need for love and intimacy. The most common mental health problems that have been identified since the onset of the pandemic are anxiety, depression, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and substance abuse. In conclusion, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of risk factors that can endanger mental health have been identified, as well as protective factors, such as psychological resilience.",

The aims of this study were to establish an in vitro induced pluripotent stem cell model (iPSC) of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) from patients with an aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma and to examine whether doxorubicin (DOX)-treated ACT-iPSC cardiomyocytes (CM) can recapitulate the clinical features exhibited by patients, and thus help uncover a DOX-dependent pathomechanism. ACT-iPSC CM generated from individuals with CD20+ B-cell lymphoma who had received high doses of DOX and suffered cardiac dysfunction were studied and compared to control-iPSC CM from cancer survivors without cardiac symptoms. In cellular studies, ACT-iPSC CM were persistently more susceptible to DOX toxicity including augmented disorganized myofilament structure, changed mitochondrial shape, and increased apoptotic events. Consistently, ACT-iPSC CM and cardiac fibroblasts isolated from fibrotic human ACT myocardium exhibited higher DOX-dependent reactive oxygen species. In functional studies, Ca2+ transient amplitude of ACT-iPSC CM was reduced compared to control cells, and diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak was DOX-dependently increased. This could be explained by overactive CaMKII\u03b4 in ACT CM. Together with DOX-dependent augmented proarrhythmic cellular triggers and prolonged action potentials in ACT CM, this suggests a cellular link to arrhythmogenic events and contractile dysfunction especially found in ACT engineered human myocardium. CamKII\u03b4 inhibition prevented proarrhythmic triggers in ACT. In contrast, control CM upregulated SERCA2a expression in a DOX-dependent manner, possibly to avoid heart failure conditions.

        "input": "Same-day discharge (SDD) after minimally invasive hysterectomy for benign or malignant gynecologic conditions has been shown to be safe and feasible, but remains challenging to implement. We designed and implemented a quality improvement perioperative program for minimally invasive gynecologic oncology surgery (MIGOS). Our aim was to improve SDD rate from 30% to 75% over the study period, while maintaining acceptable 30-day perioperative outcomes and patient experience. Consecutive patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy at a single cancer centre were included during the 9-month project period and a historical cohort of 100 consecutive patients was identified for comparison. A team of gynecologic oncologists, anesthesiologists, and nurses developed a comprehensive perioperative care program and met bi-weekly to revise interventions through plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Patients were followed for 30 days after discharge. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of pre-MIGOS and MIGOS patient cohorts using Wilcoxon rank-sum or Fisher exact tests. We used a run chart to monitor effects of interventions on outcomes and a pre-post analysis to evaluate for statistical significance of change in SDD and perioperative outcomes. We assessed 100 consecutive pre-MIGOS and 79 consecutive MIGOS patients. Overall SDD rates increased from 31% (31/100) to 71% (56/79) after implementation (p<0.001) (Figure 1). There was a consistent increase in SDD rate after implementation, although more pronounced following the start of the COVID pandemic. The MIGOS cohort was significantly younger (59 vs. 65;p=0.04) and had shorter operative times (168 vs. 202 minutes;p<0.001) but the two groups were not different with respect to BMI, comorbidity, stage distribution, type of procedure performed, and intraoperative blood loss. We found no difference in 30-day perioperative complication rates, readmission, reoperation, clinic visits, emergency department visits, mortality or morbidity. The most common reason for overnight admission was nausea and vomiting (35%), complications related to pre-existing comorbidities (15%) and urinary retention (10%). Overall, 89% of MIGOS patients rated their experience as 'very good' or 'excellent', and 87% felt that their post-operative length of stay was adequate. [Display omitted] Following implementation of a perioperative quality improvement program targeted towards minimally invasive gynecologic oncology surgery, a multidisciplinary team significantly improved SDD rates while maintaining low 30-day perioperative complications and excellent patient experience.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: To understand the multiple and wide-ranging impacts of intensified youth sport, the need for a holistic approach to athlete development has recently been advocated. Sports schools are an increasingly popular operationalisation of intensified youth sport, aiming to offer an optimal environment for holistic development by combining sport and education. Yet, no study has systematically explored the impacts associated with sports schools. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this mixed method systematic review were to (1) determine the characteristics and features of sports schools; (2) identify the methods used to evaluate sports school impacts, and (3) evaluate the positive and negative holistic athlete development impacts associated with sports school programme involvement. METHODS: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, eight electronic databases were searched until the final return in February 2021. Forty-six articles satisfied the inclusion criteria, were analysed thematically, and synthesised using a narrative approach. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS: Findings indicated (1) sports school student-athletes receive considerable support in terms of academic and athletic services, more intensified training and competition schedules with high-level training partners, but regularly miss school; (2) multiple methods have been used to evaluate student-athlete impacts, making comparison across studies and developing consensus on the impacts of sports schools difficult; and (3) there are a multitude of immediate, short- and long-term positive and negative impacts associated with the academic/vocational, athletic/physical, psychosocial and psychological development of sports school student-athletes. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to systematically review the research literature to understand the impacts associated with sports schools in terms of holistic athlete development. Practitioners should be aware that they can promote (positive) and negate (negative) health impacts through the design of an appropriate learning environment that simultaneously balances multiple training, academic, psychosocial and psychological factors that can be challenging for youth athletes. We recommend that practitioners aim to design and implement monitoring and evaluation tools that assess the holistic development of student-athletes within their sports schools to ensure they are promoting all-round and healthy youth athlete development.",

I have full movement without hindrance, BUT there is that bony, hard protrusion above the shoulder. I have not dared to use full strength on that shoulder and dare not use my bicycle on hills.

        "chosen": "Here is the rewritten output:\n\nThank you for sharing your concerns about your right shoulder problem, Peter. Based on your description, I think it's possible that what you're experiencing could be related to frozen shoulder or soft tissue damage in the shoulder joint. The protrusion you mentioned above the shoulder joint is an important detail - can you tell me if this has been present since birth or did it start recently? Is it always there, even when your hand is at rest and not moving, or does it only appear when you move your arm up with the shoulder movement?\n\nAdditionally, I want to clarify that the bone tightness you're feeling in your shoulder could be due to reduced movement as well. This might cause the surrounding soft tissues to become tight, which can contribute to the sensation of a protrusion.\n\nI would recommend consulting an orthopedic doctor or physiotherapist to get a proper examination and diagnosis. If needed, they may request an MRI scan to further assess the situation. Based on the diagnosis, if it's a mild to moderate issue, physiotherapy treatment and exercises should be sufficient to help you recover. However, if there is significant damage to the soft tissue or joint capsule, surgical correction might be necessary followed by post-operative physiotherapy for healing and rehabilitation.\n\nIn the meantime, using hot and cold packs on your shoulder painful area can also provide relief from pain. I'm confident that with proper treatment and care, you'll make a full recovery soon. Take care!",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To rapidly develop, validate, and implement a novel real-time mortality score for the COVID-19 pandemic that improves upon SOFA for decision support for a Crisis Standards of Care team. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed, verified, and deployed a stacked generalization model to predict mortality using data available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We verified the model with prospectively collected data from 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: The prospective cohort included 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) required intensive care unit care, 1,480 (5.4%) required mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, the stacked model predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85. DISCUSSION: Stacked regression allows a flexible, updatable, live-implementable, ethically defensible predictive analytics tool for decision support that begins with validated models and includes only novel information that improves prediction. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model that improved upon SOFA.",

In this article, the adverse health impacts on PWDs during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the \"everyday emergencies\" in cities for PWDs and that these can be avoided through more inclusive community planning, a whole-of-government commitment to equal access, and implementation of universal design strategies. Importantly, COVID-19 can place PWDs at a higher risk of infection since some may already have compromised immune and respiratory systems and policy responses, such as social distancing, can lead to life-threatening disruptions in care for those that rely on home heath or personal assistants. Living in cities may already present health-damaging challenges for PWDs, such as through lack of access to services and employment, physical barriers on streets and transportation, and smart-city technologies that are not made universally accessible. We suggest that the current pandemic be viewed as an opportunity for significant urban health reforms on the scale of the sanitary and governance reforms that followed ninetieth century urban epidemics. This perspective offers insights for ensuring the twenty-first century response to COVID-19 focuses on promoting more inclusive and healthy cities for all.",

In the United States, awareness about PrEP has steadily increased over time among individuals vulnerable to HIV, however awareness has not translated into widescale uptake. Estimates are that fewer than 20% of 1.2 million Americans for whom PrEP is indicated are utilizing it. We sought to understand how individuals moved from PrEP awareness to PrEP utilization. Methods: We conducted a series (n = 31) of in-depth interviews with young people, predominantly gay and bisexual men, ages 18-29 years old between February 2015 and January 2016, as part of the evaluation of a multi-year demonstration project funded to test innovative approaches to improve sexual health outcomes and curb the HIV epidemic in California. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We conducted a thematic analysis. Results: We present a continuum of PrEP awareness that spans three phases-basic, moderate and advanced. Participants rarely reported becoming well-informed about PrEP over the course of an initial exposure to PrEP information. Learning occurred after multiple exposures to PrEP information through numerous intersecting forms, messengers and formal and informal communication channels. Positively framed messages delivered by formal messengers emphasizing PrEP as a sensible HIV prevention strategy and explicitly communicating a regard for sexual wellness were overwhelmingly persuasive and facilitated movement to the advanced awareness phase. Once participants reached the advanced phase of PrEP awareness, uptake was possible. Conclusions: Our analysis provides insights into how PrEP awareness led to PrEP uptake among young gay and bi-sexual men. Building demand among those in the basic awareness phase took longer than those in the moderate phase. Individuals involved in formal and informal PrEP education can set reasonable expectations about whether, when and how eventual uptake may occur when keeping the continuum of PrEP awareness framework in mind. Many young, gay and bi-sexual male prospective PrEP users will benefit from positively framed messages that emphasize personal well-being, including social, sexual and emotional benefits of PrEP use.",

        "instruction": "help with obesity I would like help on my obesity problem and if I can get help",
        "input": " Obesity Overview Obesity is a complex disorder involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It increases your risk of diseases and health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Being extremely obese means you are especially likely to have health problems related to your weight. The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. Dietary changes, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medications and weight-loss surgery are additional options for treating obesity. Symptoms Obesity is diagnosed when your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or higher. Your body mass index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms (kg) by your height in meters (m) squared. For most people, BMI provides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However, BMI doesn't directly measure body fat, so some people, such as muscular athletes, may have a BMI in the obese category even though they don't have excess body fat. Ask your doctor if your BMI is a problem. When to see a doctor If you think you may be obese, and especially if you're concerned about weight-related health problems, see your doctor or health care provider. You and your provider can evaluate your health risks and discuss your weight-loss options. Causes Although there are genetic, behavioral and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through exercise and normal daily activities. Your body stores these excess calories as fat. Obesity can sometimes be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, and other diseases and conditions. However, these disorders are rare and, in general, the principal causes of obesity are: - Inactivity. If you're not very active, you don't burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you use through exercise and normal daily activities. - Unhealthy diet and eating habits. Weight gain is inevitable if you regularly eat more calories than you burn. And most Americans' diets are too high in calories and are full of fast food and high-calorie beverages. Risk factors Obesity usually results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including: - Genetics. Your genes may affect the amount of body fat you store, and where that fat is distributed. Genetics may also play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy and how your body burns calories during exercise. - Family lifestyle. Obesity tends to run in families. If one or both of your parents are obese, your risk of being obese is increased. That's not just because of genetics. Family members tend to share similar eating and activity habits. - Inactivity. If you're not very active, you don't burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you burn through exercise and routine daily activities. Having medical problems, such as arthritis, can lead to decreased activity, which contributes to weight gain. - Unhealthy diet. A diet that's high in calories, lacking in fruits and vegetables, full of fast food, and laden with high-calorie beverages and oversized portions contributes to weight gain. - Medical problems. In some people, obesity can be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing's syndrome and other conditions. Medical problems, such as arthritis, also can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain. - Certain medications. Some medications can lead to weight gain if you don't compensate through diet or activity. These medications include some antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, diabetes medications, antipsychotic medications, steroids and beta blockers. - Social and economic issues. Research has linked social and economic factors to obesity. Avoiding obesity is difficult if you don't have safe areas to exercise. Similarly, you may not have been taught healthy ways of cooking, or you may not have money to buy healthier foods. In addition, the people you spend time with may influence your weight - you're more likely to become obese if you have obese friends or relatives. - Age. Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. In addition, the amount of muscle in your body tends to decrease with age. This lower muscle mass leads to a decrease in metabolism. These changes also reduce calorie needs, and can make it harder to keep off excess weight. If you don't consciously control what you eat and become more physically active as you age, you'll likely gain weight. - Pregnancy. During pregnancy, a woman's weight necessarily increases. Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women. - Quitting smoking. Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. And for some, it can lead to enough weight gain that the person becomes obese. In the long run, however, quitting smoking is still a greater benefit to your health than continuing to smoke. - Lack of sleep. Not getting enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that increase your appetite. You may also crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain. Even if you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn't mean that you're destined to become obese. You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise, and behavior changes. Complications If you're obese, you're more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health problems, including: - High triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol - Type 2 diabetes - High blood pressure - Metabolic syndrome - a combination of high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol - Heart disease - Stroke - Cancer, including cancer of the uterus, cervix, endometrium, ovaries, breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidney and prostate - Breathing disorders, including sleep apnea, a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts - Gallbladder disease - Gynecological problems, such as infertility and irregular periods - Erectile dysfunction and sexual health issues - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which fat builds up in the liver and can cause inflammation or scarring - Osteoarthritis Quality of life When you're obese, your overall quality of life may be diminished. You may not be able to do things you used to do, such as participating in enjoyable activities. You may avoid public places. Obese people may even encounter discrimination. Other weight-related issues that may affect your quality of life include: - Depression - Disability - Sexual problems - Shame and guilt - Social isolation - Lower work achievement Diagnosis If your BMI is in the obese range, your health care provider will typically review your health history in detail, perform a physical exam and recommend some tests. These exams and tests generally include: - Taking your health history. Your doctor may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, exercise habits, eating patterns, what other conditions you've had, medications, stress levels and other issues about your health. Your doctor may also review your family's health history to see if you may be predisposed to certain conditions. - A general physical exam. This includes also measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. - Calculating your BMI. Your doctor will check your body mass index (BMI) to determine your level of obesity. This should be done at least once a year. Your BMI also helps determine your overall health risk and what treatment may be appropriate. - Measuring your waist circumference. Fat stored around your waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase your risk of diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. Women with a waist measurement (circumference) of more than 35 inches (80 centimeters, or cm) and men with a waist measurement of more than 40 inches (102 cm) may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, your waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. - Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your doctor will evaluate them. Your doctor will also check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. - Blood tests. What tests you have depend on your health, risk factors and any current symptoms you may be having. Tests may include a cholesterol test, liver function tests, a fasting glucose, a thyroid test and others. Your doctor may also recommend certain heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram. Gathering all this information helps you and your doctor determine how much weight you need to lose and what health conditions or risks you already have. And this will guide treatment decisions. Treatment The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. You may need to work with a team of health professionals - including a dietitian, behavior counselor or an obesity specialist - to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The initial treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss - 3 to 5 percent of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kg) and are obese by BMI standards, you would need to lose only about 6 to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kg) for your health to begin to improve. However, the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require changes in your eating habits and increased physical activity. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your level of obesity, your overall health and your willingness to participate in your weight-loss plan. Other treatment tools include: - Dietary changes - Exercise and activity - Behavior change - Prescription weight-loss medications - Weight-loss surgery Dietary changes Reducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are vital to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, slow and steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight and the best way to keep it off permanently. Avoid drastic and unrealistic diet changes, such as crash diets, because they're unlikely to help you keep excess weight off for the long term. Plan to participate in a comprehensive weight-loss program for at least six months and in the maintenance phase of a program for at least a year to boost your odds of weight-loss success. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: - Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. You and your health care providers can review your typical eating and drinking habits to see how many calories you normally consume and where you can cut back. You and your doctor can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight, but a typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. - Feeling full on less. The concept of energy density can help you satisfy your hunger with fewer calories. All foods have a certain number of calories within a given amount (volume). Some foods - such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods - are high in energy density. This means that a small volume of that food has a large number of calories. In contrast, other foods, such as fruits and vegetables, have lower energy density. These foods provide a larger portion size with a fewer number of calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you reduce hunger pangs, take in fewer calories and feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. - Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole-grain carbohydrates. Also emphasize lean sources of protein - such as beans, lentils and soy - and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Stick with low-fat dairy products. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. - Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your doctor which diet plans have been found effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended, and limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. - Meal replacements. These plans suggest that you replace one or two meals with their products - such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars - and eat healthy snacks and a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. Keep in mind that these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle, though, so you may have to keep this up if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. The reality, however, is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight - and keep it off - you have to adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activity Increased physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment. Most people who are able to maintain their weight loss for more than a year get regular exercise, even simply walking. To boost your activity level: - Exercise. People who are overweight or obese need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity to prevent further weight gain or to maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. To achieve more-significant weight loss, you may need to exercise 300 minutes or more a week. You probably will need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. - Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. Making simple changes throughout your day can add up to big benefits. Park farther from store entrances, rev up your household chores, garden, get up and move around periodically, and wear a pedometer to track how many steps you actually take over the course of a day. Behavior changes A behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes and lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include examining your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Everyone is different and has different obstacles to managing weight, such as a lack of time to exercise or late-night eating. Tailor your behavior changes to address your individual concerns. Behavior modification, sometimes called behavior therapy, can include: - Counseling. Therapy or interventions with trained mental health or other professionals can help you address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You can also learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Therapy can take place on both an individual and group basis. More-intensive programs - those that include 12 to 26 sessions a year - may be more helpful in achieving your weight-loss goals. - Support groups. You can find camaraderie and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your doctor, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area, such as Weight Watchers. Prescription weight-loss medication Losing weight requires a healthy diet and regular exercise. But in certain situations, prescription weight-loss medication may help. Keep in mind, though, that weight-loss medication is meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. If you don't make these other changes in your life, medication is unlikely to work. Your doctor may recommend weight-loss medication if other methods of weight loss haven't worked for you and you meet one of the following criteria: - Your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or greater - Your BMI is greater than 27, and you also have medical complications of obesity, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or sleep apnea Before selecting a medication for you, your doctor will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. Some weight-loss medications can't be used by women who are pregnant, or people who take certain medications or have chronic health conditions. Commonly prescribed weight-loss medications include orlistat (Xenical), lorcaserin (Belviq), phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia), buproprion and naltrexone (Contrave), and liraglutide (Saxenda). You will need close medical monitoring while taking a prescription weight-loss medication. Also, keep in mind that a weight-loss medication may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medication, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Weight-loss surgery In some cases, weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is an option. Weight-loss surgery limits the amount of food you're able to comfortably eat or decreases the absorption of food and calories or both. While weight-loss surgery offers the best chance of losing the most weight, it can pose serious risks. Weight-loss surgery for obesity may be considered if you have tried other methods to lose weight that haven't worked and: - You have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or higher) - Your BMI is 35 to 39.9, and you also have a serious weight-related health problem, such as diabetes or high blood pressure - You're committed to making the lifestyle changes that are necessary for surgery to work It doesn't guarantee that you'll lose all of your excess weight or that you'll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. It doesn't guarantee that you'll lose all of your excess weight or that you'll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Common weight-loss surgeries include: - Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of your stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of your stomach. - Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). In this procedure, your stomach is separated into two pouches with an inflatable band. Pulling the band tight, like a belt, the surgeon creates a tiny channel between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from expanding and is generally designed to stay in place permanently. - Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. This procedure begins with the surgeon removing a large part of the stomach. The surgeon leaves the valve that releases food to the small intestine and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Then the surgeon closes off the middle section of the intestine and attaches the last part directly to the duodenum. The separated section of the intestine is reattached to the end of the intestine to allow bile and digestive juices to flow into this part of the intestine. - Gastric sleeve. In this procedure, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Other treatments Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology received FDA approval in 2014 for use by adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss program and who have a BMI of 35 to 45 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes. Preventing weight regain after obesity treatment Unfortunately, it's common to regain weight no matter what obesity treatment methods you try. If you take weight-loss medications, you'll probably regain weight when you stop taking them. You might even regain weight after weight-loss surgery if you continue to overeat or overindulge in high-calorie foods. But that doesn't mean your weight-loss efforts are futile. One of the best ways to prevent regaining the weight you've lost is to get regular physical activity. Aim for 60 minutes a day. Keep track of your physical activity if it helps you stay motivated and on course. As you lose weight and gain better health, talk to your doctor about what additional activities you might be able to do and, if appropriate, how to give your activity and exercise a boost. You may always have to remain vigilant about your weight. Combining a healthier diet and more activity in a practical and sustainable manner are the best ways to keep the weight you lost off for the long term. Take your weight loss and weight maintenance one day at a time and surround yourself with supportive resources to help ensure your success. Find a healthier way of living that you can stick with for the long term. Lifestyle and home remedies Your effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home in addition to your formal treatment plan. These can include: - Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you became obese and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your doctor or therapist. - Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a significant amount of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul. - Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be difficult. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care providers if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches. - Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You might also want to join a weight-loss support group. - Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover behavior that may be holding you back and, conversely, what works well for you. You can also use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels and overall fitness. - Identifying and avoiding food triggers. Distract yourself from your desire to eat with something positive, such as calling a friend. Practice saying no to unhealthy foods and big portions. Eat when you're actually hungry - not simply when the clock says it's time to eat. - Taking your medications as directed. If you take weight-loss medications or medications to treat obesity-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, take them exactly as prescribed. If you have a problem sticking with your medication regimen or have unpleasant side effects, talk to your doctor. Alternative medicine Numerous dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The effectiveness, particularly the long-term effectiveness, and safety of these products are often questionable. Herbal remedies, vitamins and minerals, all considered dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration, don't have the same rigorous testing and labeling process as over-the-counter and prescription medications do. Yet some of these substances, including products labeled as \"natural,\" have drug-like effects that can be dangerous. Even some vitamins and minerals can cause problems when taken in excessive amounts. Ingredients may not be standard, and they can cause unpredictable and harmful side effects. Dietary supplements also can cause dangerous interactions with prescription medications you take. Talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. Mind-body therapies - such as acupuncture, mindfulness meditation and yoga - may complement other obesity treatments. However, these therapies generally haven't been well-studied in the treatment of weight loss. Talk to your doctor if you're interested in adding a mind-body therapy to your treatment. ",

OBJECTIVE To explore the application of the AAV9-coGLB1 for effective treatment in a GM1 gangliosidosis mutant mouse model. METHODS We designed a novel adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) vector expressing \u03b2-gal (AAV9-coGLB1) to treat GM1 gangliosidosis. The vector, injected via the caudal vein at 4 weeks of age, drove the widespread and sustained expression of \u03b2-gal for up to 32 weeks in the Glb1G455R/G455R mutant mice (GM1 mice). RESULTS The increased levels of \u03b2-gal reduced the pathological damage occurring in GM1 mice. Histological analyses showed that myelin deficits and neuron-specific pathology were reduced in cerebral cortex region of AAV9-coGLB1-treated mice. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside was also reduced after gene therapy. The reduction of the storage in these regions was accompanied by a decrease in activated microglia. In addition, AAV9 treatment reversed the blockade of autophagic flux in GM1 mice. CONCLUSION These results show that AAV9-coGLB1 reduces the pathological signs of GM1 gangliosidosis in a mouse model.",

One of the policies made by the Indonesian government is the implementation of PSBB (Large-Scale Social Restrictions) in several affected areas. The impact of the application is none other than attacking various sectors of life especially on the speed of state finances which are experiencing a decline. Therefore, the presence of the New Normal as a post-PSBB transition is used as an opening door for the tourism sector in helping to stabilize state finances. Because the tourism sector is one of the mainstays in generating foreign exchange. Therefore, in this paper two formulations of the problem are taken namely First, what is the role of the tourism sector in stabilizing state finances? Second, what is the strategy carried out by the government in opening a new normal as a post-PSSB transition in the tourism sector? The research method in this writing is done by using normative juridical research. The purpose of this paper is to find out the role of the tourism sector in stabilizing state finances in the COVID-19 era. Keywords: New Normal;State Finance;Tourism Sector Sebagai negara yang terkena dampak pandemi COVID-19, menjadi catatan khusus bagi pemerintah Indonesia untuk membuat kebijakan agar penyebaran COVID-19 dapat teratasi. Salah satu kebijakan yang dilakukan pemerintah Indonesia adalah pemberlakuan PSBB (Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar) di beberapa daerah terdampak. Dampak dari penerapan tersebut tak lain menyerang berbagai sektor kehidupan, terutama pada kecepatan keuangan negara yang sedang mengalami penurunan. Oleh karena itu, kehadiran New Normal sebagai transisi pasca PSBB dijadikan sebagai \u201cpintu pembuka\u201d bagi sektor pariwisata dalam membantu menstabilkan keuangan negara. Pasalnya, sektor pariwisata merupakan salah satu andalan dalam menghasilkan devisa negara. Oleh karena itu, dalam tulisan ini diambil dua rumusan masalah yaitu Pertama, apa peran sektor pariwisata dalam menstabilkan keuangan negara? Kedua, bagaimana strategi yang dilakukan pemerintah dalam membuka new normal sebagai transisi pasca PSSB di sektor pariwisata?

Sensing the level and distributions of impurities help in the control of building systems and mitigate long term health risks. Rapid detection of infectious diseases in large public areas like airports and train stations may help limit exposure and aid in reducing the spread of the disease. Complete coverage by sensors to account for any release scenario of chemical or biological warfare agents may provide the opportunity to develop isolation and evacuation plans that mitigate the impact of the attack. All these scenarios involve strategic placement of sensors to promptly detect and rapidly respond. This paper presents a data driven sensor placement algorithm based on a dynamical systems approach. The approach utilizes the finite dimensional Perron-Frobenius (PF) concept. The PF operator (or the Markov matrix) is used to construct an observability gramian that naturally incorporates sensor accuracy, location constraints, and sensing constraints. The algorithm determines the response times, sensor coverage maps, and the number of sensors needed. The utility of the procedure is illustrated using four examples: a literature example of the flow field inside an aircraft cabin and three air flow fields in different geometries. The effect of the constraints on the response times for different sensor placement scenarios is investigated. Knowledge of the response time and coverage of the multiple sensors aides in the design of mechanical systems and response mechanisms. The methodology provides a simple process for place sensors in a building, analyze the sensor coverage maps and response time necessary during extreme events, as well as evaluate indoor air quality. The theory established in this paper also allows for future work in topics related to construction of classical estimator problems for the sensors, real-time contaminant transport, and development of agent dispersion, contaminant isolation/removal, and evacuation strategies.",

        "input": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has put much of the world into lockdown which led to the unintended and positive changes in the environment surrounding us. It has benefited human race as it has led to improve air quality post-pandemic. Several studies state that the concentration of the various pollutants has decreased, where NO2 air quality index value falls more precipitously (23\u201337%) relative to the pre-lockdown period, followed by PM10 (14\u201320%), SO2 (2\u201320%), PM2.5 (7\u201316%), and CO (7\u201311%), but the O3 increases 10\u201327%. Due to this Covid-19 pandemic, D.C. has witnessed the cleanest spring since the last few decades, and L.A., one of the highly polluted city of the USA, has experienced improvement in the air quality. Air quality has always been an important issue where several big countries like China the COVID-19 outbreak has improved the air quality and lowered the pollution levels. According to several data analysis in the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment, PM concentration levels decreased by more than 20% during January and April in more than 300 cities when compared to the previous month\u2019s pollution levels. There were many cities in which the air pollution level fell drastically during lockdown, 16% in Hong Kong, and 13% in Sydney and in 14% in Singapore. Few researchers studied that when restrictions were eased the PM 2.5 level increased for cities like Beijing, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Madrid, Cape Town and New York. There were cities like New York the pollution level took a dip during the peak lockdown by 59%. Also when talking about the Indian context, the air quality improved for several cities and states including Maharashtra being worst hit state. The air pollution level resulted in \u2018satisfactory\u2019 level (AQI) due to this lockdown. After this dip, there was again a peak at 33% increase in the air pollution when the city slowly started and reached to the pre-lockdown levels. This air quality has direct impact on the health of the people. Several air pollutants like NOx have resulted on harmful effects such as increasing heart and lung disease. When examining the Indian population, around 7% of total population is above the age of 65 and 27% in the age 0\u201314 who are more prone to the air pollution leading diseases like asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and possibly cancer. This onset of pandemic has cleared the thought of people where immediate changes in air quality within dense population/industry can be improved based on pollution mitigation. This chapter focuses on the worldwide air pollution studies and the findings can be implemented to maintain clean air. In addition, attempt has been made to assess the temporal behavior of daily Tropospheric Columnar NO2 Flux and Ground-level NO2 concentration for three days, one each in pre-lockdown, during lockdown and post-lockdown for three major cities of world, viz. New York, Mumbai and Wuhan. Also, NO2 pollution assessment is done by mapping the remotely sensed columnar tropospheric NO2 fluxes. Moreover, accelerated information approximately the hyperlink among air pollutants and COVID-19 can be useful worldwide with the aid of using informing public regarding fitness measures and sickness control techniques in scientific practice. The findings will be utilized by policymakers to set new benchmarks for air pollutants that could enhance the high-satisfactory lifestyles for principal sectors of the World\u2019s populace and additionally to cut down the air pollutants in destiny with the aid of enforcing the strategic lockdowns on the pollutant hotspots with minimum financial drop. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

Metasurfaces consisting of subwavelength structures show great potential in light field manipulation, which is useful for overcoming the drawbacks of common computer-generated holography. However, there are long-existing challenges to achieving dynamic meta-holography in the visible range, such as low frame rate and low frame number. In this work, we demonstrate a design of meta-holography that can achieve 2(28) different holographic frames and an extremely high frame rate (9523 frames per second) in the visible range. The design is based on a space channel metasurface and a high-speed dynamic structured laser beam modulation module. The space channel consists of silicon nitride nanopillars with a high modulation efficiency. This method can satisfy the needs of a holographic display and be useful in other applications, such as laser fabrication, optical storage, optics communications, and information processing.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) among adult patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules for chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, in particular chronic inflammatory arthritides. METHODS: To this end, a population-based study, in the province of Udine (466,700 inhabitants, with age > 15 years old, Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy) was planned. The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051). RESULTS: From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4,5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, p value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed.. CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population. Patients should be informed to safely proceed with their treatment and follow the rules for self-protection to COVID-19.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) is widely recommended to protect staff and patients. A previous systematic review examined interventions to encourage uptake finding that hard mandates, such as loss of employment for non-vaccination, were more effective than soft mandates, such as signing a declination form, or other interventions such as incentives. Despite these overarching patterns the authors of the review concluded that \u2018substantial heterogeneity\u2019 remained requiring further analysis. This paper reanalyses the evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine whether the strategies used to implement interventions explain the residual heterogeneity. METHODS: We used ICA to extract implementation features and trialists\u2019 reflections on what underpinned the success of the intervention they evaluated. The ICA findings then informed and structured two QCA analyses to systematically examine associations between implementation features and intervention outcomes. Analysis 1 examined hard mandate studies. Analysis 2 examined soft mandates and other interventions. RESULTS: In Analysis 1 ICA revealed the significance of \u2018leading from the front\u2019 rather than \u2018top-down\u2019 implementation of hard mandates. Four key features underpinned this: providing education prior to implementation; two-way engagement so HCW can voice concerns prior to implementation; previous use of other strategies so that institutions \u2018don\u2019t-go-in-cold\u2019 with hard-mandates; and support from institutional leadership. QCA revealed that either of two configurations were associated with greater success of hard mandates. The first involves two-way engagement, leadership support and a \u2018don\u2019t-go-in-cold\u2019 approach. The second involves leadership support, education and a \u2018don\u2019t-go-in-cold\u2019 approach. Reapplying the \u2018leading from the front\u2019 theory in Analysis 2 revealed similar patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of intervention type a \u2018leading from the front\u2019 approach to implementation will likely enhance intervention success. While the results pertain to flu vaccination among HCWs, the components identified here may be relevant to public health campaigns regarding COVID-19 vaccination.

Notwithstanding the fact that pneumonia is the primary symptom of the novel coronavirus (2019nCoV; designated as SARS-CoV-2), the emergence of severe disease mainly due to the injury of nonpulmonary organs at the shadow of coagulopathy leaves no choice, in some cases, rather than a dreadful death. Multiple casual factors such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, platelet and complement activation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system derangement, and hypoxemia play a major role in the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Due to the undeniable role of coagulation dysfunction in the initiation of several complications, assessment of coagulation parameters and the platelet count would be beneficial in early diagnosis and also timely prediction of disease severity. Although low-molecular-weight heparin is considered as the first-line of treatment in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, several possible therapeutic options have also been proposed for better management of the disease. In conclusion, this review would help us to gain insight into the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and laboratory findings associated with COVID-19 coagulopathy and would summarize management strategies to alleviate coagulopathy-related complications.",

This study aimed to understand what primary care staff think about patients accessing electronic health records, highlighting errors in electronic health records, and providing feedback via online patient portals. METHODS: A focus group study involving 19 clinical and non-clinical primary care staff. Primary care practices were purposively sampled based on practice size and the percentage of patients using online services. Data were analysed inductively using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were generated: (1) Information \u2013 what, why and when? (2) Changing behaviours and protecting relationships, and (3) Secure access and safeguarding. The emotional considerations and consequences for staff and patients featured prominently in the data as an overarching theme. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care staff described being invested and supportive of patients accessing their electronic health records, and acknowledged the numerous potential benefits for safety.

We aimed to determine whether NPIs led to the decline in the incidences of respiratory infections. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, ecological study using a nationwide notifiable diseases database and a respiratory virus sample surveillance collected from January 2016 through July 2020 in the Republic of Korea. Intervention period was defined as February-July 2020, when the government implemented NPIs nationwide. Observed incidences in the intervention period were compared to the predicted incidences by autoregressive integrated moving average model and the 4-year mean cumulative incidences (CuIs) in the same months of the pre-intervention period. RESULTS: Five infectious diseases met the inclusion criteria: chickenpox, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, and pertussis. The incidences of chickenpox and mumps during the intervention period were significantly lower than the prediction model. The CuIs of chickenpox and mumps were 36.4% (95% CI, 23.9-76.3) and 63.4% (95% CI, 48.0-93.3) of the predicted values. Subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in the incidence was universal for chickenpox, while mumps showed a marginal reduction among those aged <18 years, but not in adults. The incidence of respiratory viruses was significantly lower than both the predicted incidence (19.5%; 95% CI, 11.8-55.4%) and the 4-year mean CuIs in the pre-intervention period (24.5%; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of NPIs was associated with a significant reduction in the incidences of several respiratory infections in Korea.",

These facts suggest an evasion of the immune system by virulent TGEV. In this study, we showed that a virulent TGEV SHXB strain could infect porcine immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs), and down-regulate cell surface markers (SLA-II-DR, CD1a and CD80/86). Moreover, SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs showed low expression of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, and also lost the ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. Finally, SHXB inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in these cells. Instead, UV-inactivated SHXB (UV-SHXB) had the opposite effects in immature Mo-DCs. In conclusion, the virulent SHXB could severely impair immature Mo-DCs, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of virulent TGEV in vivo.",

METHODS A full-thickness excision is made on the rectal wall down to the perirectal fatty tissue. The specimen is retrieved transanally. After the parietal defect is disinfected, the wound is closed with one or more running sutures secured with silver clips. RESULTS Peritoneal perforation during TEM is not associated with adverse short-term or oncologic outcomes. The postoperative morbidity rate ranges between 2 % and 15 %, and in most cases, complications can be conservatively managed. The local recurrence rate of large adenomas is about 6 %, and most recurrences can be safely re-resected by TEM. TEM represents an effective treatment for pT1 sm1 rectal malignancies, while pT1 sm2-3 and pT2 should be considered at high risk of recurrence if treated by TEM alone. Finally, TEM does not influence anorectal function or quality of life. CONCLUSION TEM is a safe procedure and provides excellent functional and oncologic outcomes in the treatment of large sessile benign rectal lesions and selected early rectal cancers.",

Consequently, many machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict adverse events. However, little research focuses on how these systems are implemented and how system design impacts clinicians' decisions or patient outcomes. This protocol outlines the steps to review the designs of these tools. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use scoping review methods to explore how tools that leverage machine learning algorithms in predicting adverse events are designed to integrate into clinical practice. We will explore the types of user interfaces deployed, what information is displayed, and how clinical workflows are supported. Electronic sources include Medline, Embase, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL), and IEEE Xplore from 1 January 2009 to present. We will only review primary research articles that report findings from the implementation of patient deterioration surveillance tools for hospital clinicians. The articles must also include a description of the tool's user interface. Since our primary focus is on how the user interacts with automated tools driven by machine learning algorithms, electronic tools that do not extract data from clinical data documentation or recording systems such as an EHR or patient monitor, or otherwise require manual entry, will be excluded. Similarly, tools that do not synthesise information from more than one data variable will also be excluded. This review will be limited to English-language articles. Two reviewers will review the articles and extract the data. Findings from both researchers will be compared with minimise bias. The results will be quantified, synthesised and presented using appropriate formats. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics review is not required for this scoping review.

As campus activities ceased, student-athletes abruptly became isolated from teammates and were no longer able to participate in sport activities that are often central to their identity as an athlete. However, student-athletes who have supportive social connections with teammates during this pandemic may maintain their athletic identity to a greater extent and report better mental health. The present study examined how student-athletes\u2019 mental health was associated with teammate social support, connectedness, and changes to athletic identity from before to during COVID-19. METHOD: A sample of 234 student-athletes completed surveys before COVID-19 physical distancing (February 2020), with 135 (63% female) participating in a follow-up in the month following school closures (April 2020). Path models estimated the effects of teammate social support and connectedness (during COVID-19), as well as changes in athletic identity on indices of mental health. RESULTS: Considering all path models tested, student-athletes who received more social support and reported more connectedness with teammates reported less dissolution of their athletic identity and\u2014in most models\u2014reported better mental health and well-being. Indirect effects indicated that student-athletes\u2019 change in athletic identity mediated the effects of teammate social support on psychological well-being and depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to advancing theory on how small groups relate to mental health, these findings demonstrate the value in remaining socially connected with peers and maintaining role identities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: To date, the majority of chest imaging studies in COVID-19 pneumonia have focused on CT. Evidence for the utility of chest radiographs (CXRs) in this population is less robust. Our objectives were to develop a systematic approach for reporting likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs, to measure the interobserver variability of this approach and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CXRs compared to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHOD: Retrospective review of patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia who attended our emergency department and underwent both CXR and a RT-PCR were included. Two radiologists reviewed the CXRs, blind to the RT-PCR, and classified them according to a structured reporting template with five categories (Characteristic, High Suspicion, Indeterminate, Unlikely and Normal) which we devised. For analysis of diagnostic accuracy, Characteristic and High Suspicion CXRs were considered positive and the remaining categories negative. Concordance between the two assessors was also measured. RESULTS: Of 582 patients (51 +/- 20 years), 143/582 (24.6 %) had a positive RT-PCR. The absolute concordance between the two assessors was 71.1 % (414/582) with a Fleiss-Cohen-weighted Cohen's &#954; of 0.81 (95 % confidence interval, 0.78-0.85). A patient with a positive CXR had an 88 % (95 % CI 80-96 %) probability of having a positive RT-PCR during a period of high incidence, early in the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Using a structured approach, a positive CXR had a high likelihood of predicting a positive RT-PCR, with good interrater reliability. CXRs can be useful in identifying new cases of COVID-19.",

We examined associations between social media use, online social support, pandemic-related stress, and internalizing symptoms, and tested the moderating role of social media use on the relation between stress and symptom change across time. Methods: Emerging adults aged 18\u201325 (N = 200) self-reported pandemic-related stress, internalizing symptoms, social media use, and online social support in May 2020, then repeated measures of internalizing symptoms in August 2020. Results: Greater social media use was cross-sectionally associated with greater stress and anxiety symptoms. High social media use in conjunction with high interpersonal stress was predictive of increases in depression, whereas low online social support and high total stress was predictive of increases in anxiety. Discussion: Findings suggest that general social media usage and online social support are differentially related to internalizing symptom change among emerging adults.",

AIM: We aimed to report the largest number of COVID-19-positive cases in KTR in a single center and to discuss their demographics, management, and evolution. METHODS: We enrolled all the two thousand KTR followed up in our center in Kuwait and collected the data of all COVID-19-positive KTR (104) from the start of the outbreak till the end of July 2020 and have reported the clinical features, management details, and both patient and graft outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the one hundred and four cases reported, most of them were males aged 49.3 \u00b1 14.7 years. Eighty-two of them needed hospitalization, of which thirty-one were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Main comorbidities among these patients were hypertension in 64.4%, diabetes in 51%, and ischemic heart disease in 20.2%. Management strategies included anticoagulation in 56.7%, withdrawal of antimetabolites in 54.8%, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal in 33.7%, the addition of antibiotics in 57.7%, Tocilizumab in 8.7%, and antivirals in 16.3%. During a follow-up of 30 days, the reported number of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 28.7%, respiratory failure requiring oxygen therapy 46.2%, and overall mortality rate was 10.6% with hospital mortality of 13.4% including an ICU mortality rate of 35.5%. CONCLUSION: Better outcome of COVID-19-positive KTR in our cohort during this unremitting stage could be due to the younger age of patients and early optimized management of anticoagulation, modification of immunosuppression, and prompt treatment of secondary bacterial infections. Mild cases can successfully be managed at home without any change in immunosuppression.",

The biosensor employs cys-kemptide (CLRRASLG) as a substrate peptide which was immobilized on the surface of a gold electrode via the self-assembly of the thiol terminals in cysteine (C) residues. The interaction between protein kinase A (PKA) and adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) on the cys-kemptide immobilized electrode can cause the transfer of ATP terminal phosphates to the peptide substrates at serine (S) residues, which alters the surface charge of the electrode, thus enabling monitoring of the PKA activity via measuring the interfacial electron transfer resistance with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The proposed sensor showed reliable, sensitive, and selective detection of PKA activity with a wide dynamic range of 0.1\u2013100 U/mL and a detection limit of 56 mU/mL. The sensor also exhibited high selectivity, rendering it possible to screen PKA inhibitors. Moreover, the sensor can be employed to evaluate the activity and inhibition of PKA in real samples.",

METHODS: The cross-sectional study examined the eyes of 44 subjects, graded from the first to third keratoconus stages by Amsler-Krumeich classification. We obtained measurements in two ways: (a) by projecting two perpendicular axes onto a cornea (first, through the central point of the cornea and keratoconus apex; second, as the perpendicular axis) to read the elevation values at points on these axes as parameters characterising the corneal surface; (b) by projecting circles with different diameters around the central part of the cornea (1, 2, and 3 mm) and reading elevation values at points equally displaced on these circles as parameters characterising an anterior surface slope. Irregular corneal shape parameters' correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were determined in order to understand which corneal slope parameter has the strongest correlation with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. RESULTS: Parameters characterising the corneal surface's correlations with contrast sensitivity were from r = 0.25 (p = 0.03) at 3 cpd to r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd for the highest elevation and from r = 0.33 (p = 0.09) at 5 cpd to r = 0.40 (p < 0.01) at 11 cpd for the lowest elevation in all subjects together, while for visual acuity the parameters were r = 0.30 (p < 0.01) for the highest elevation and r = 0.21 (p = 0.06) for the lowest elevation in all subjects together. The correlation between contrast sensitivity and the highest and lowest corneal point in all measured cornea was stronger for subjects with a peripheral corneal apex than for those with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, contrast sensitivity displayed a strong correlation with slope in the central part of the cornea (with a radius of 1 mm) ranging from 0.48 (p < 0.01) at 3 cpd to 0.61 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd. CONCLUSION: Contrast sensitivity has a higher correlation with corneal shape parameters than with visual acuity. Subjects with a peripheral corneal apex had stronger correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity than did subjects with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, the strongest correlation was for contrast sensitivity and elevation (slope) in the region within a 1 mm radius of the corneal centre in the opposite direction of the keratoconus apex (direction (ax) CB).",

This study aims to investigate the psychological effect of quarantine on persons living in Morocco when the first COVID-19 cases were identified. The associations between anxiety, depression symptoms, and their predictors (sociodemographics, fatigue, and religious coping) were examined. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey, with a total of 1435 participants (&#8805;18 years) recruited anonymously, was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (from 3 to 30 April 2020). A structured questionnaire was used to assess psychosocial factors, COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, and religious coping. Religious coping, fatigue, and depression, and anxiety were measured by Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE), Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. A generalized linear model (logistic regression) was used to determine the predictive factors of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 43.0% (n = 621) and 53.0% (n = 766), respectively. Both were associated with female gender, household income decline, tracking COVID-19 news, and fear to contract COVID-19 (aOR = 1.36 to 2.85). Additionally, 32.0% (n = 453) and 26.0% (n = 372) reported severe physical fatigue, and mental fatigue, respectively. Both latter factors were significantly and positively associated with depression as well as with anxiety. Depressive and anxious patients used more negative religious coping, while positive religious coping was slightly associated with depression. CONCLUSION: In this online survey of the general population in Morocco, anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic and psychosocial factors, such as female gender, income decline, infection fears, massive COVID-19 news exposure, negative religious coping, and fatigue were associated with increased risk of depression and anxiety symptoms. Psychosocial and financial support should be provided to the quarantined population.",

Patients and Methods Age-adjusted race-stratified prevalence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity), preexisting medical conditions (pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, malignancy), poor health behaviors (smoking, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity), and adverse socioeconomic factors (education, household income, health insurance) was computed in 435,139 American adult participants from 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (BRFSS). Correlation was assessed between health determinants and the race-stratified COVID-19 crude mortality and infection-fatality-ratio computed from respective state public health departments in 47 states. Results Blacks had a higher prevalence of comorbidities (63.3% [95%CI:62.4-64.2%] vs. 55.1% [95%CI:54.7-55.5]) and adverse socioeconomic factors (47.0% [95%CI:46.0-47.9%] vs. 30.9% [95%CI:30.6-31.3]) than Whites. The prevalence of preexisting medical conditions was similar among Blacks (30.4% [95%CI:28.8-32.1%]) and Whites (30.8% [95%CI:30.2-31.4%]). The prevalence of poor health behaviors was higher in Whites (57.2% [95%CI:56.3-58.0%]) than Blacks (50.2% [95%CI:46.2-54.2%]). The comorbidities and adverse socioeconomic factors were highest in the Southern region, and poor health behaviors were highest in the Western region. Cumulative incidence rate (per 100,000 persons) was three-fold higher in Blacks (1546.4) compared withwith Whites (540.4). The crude mortality (per 100,000 persons) was two-fold higher in Blacks (83.2) than Whites (33.2). However, the infection-fatality-ratio (per 100-cases) was similar between Whites (6.2) and Blacks (5.4). Within racial groups, the geographic distribution of health determinants did not correlate with state-level COVID-19 mortality and infection-fatality ratio (p>0.05 for all). Conclusions Racial disparities in COVID-19 are largely driven by the higher cumulative incidence of infection in Blacks. There is a discordance between the geographic dispersion of COVID-19 mortality and the regional distribution of health determinants.",

The influence of public health measures and messaging on leisure put older and younger people alike at increased risk of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and isolation. Despite these similar experiences, ageism and tensions between generations intensified during the pandemic. Thus, it is imperative to encourage strategies that foster connections and solidarity between generations, such as participating in intergenerational family leisure. Intergenerational family leisure can both attenuate negative outcomes heightened or created by the pandemic (i.e. risk reduction) and increase positive experiences (i.e. wellness promotion). However, it is important to recognize that intergenerational family leisure may not be available or ideal for everyone, especially during the pandemic. There are longstanding and pandemic-specific pitfalls to engaging in intergenerational family leisure that need to be considered. Further, the conditions and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic have complicated intergenerational family leisure in paradoxical ways. Many contradictions emerge as people navigate social systems and personal experiences when engaging in intergenerational family leisure in the COVID-19 context.

They are often enriched in non-lymphoid tissues and exhibit diverse functional attributes including rapid activation, cytokine production, proliferation, and acquisition of cytotoxicity following both TCR-dependent and TCR-independent stimulation, but poor capacity for immunological memory. They can detect a broad range of antigens, although typically not peptide-MHC complexes in contrast to alpha-beta (\u03b1\u03b2) T cells. In humans, a prominent population of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, defined as V\u03b39V\u03b42+ cells, reacts to small phosphorylated non-peptide \"phosphoantigens\" (pAgs). The molecular mechanism underpinning this recognition is poorly defined, but is known to involve butyrophilin family members and appears to involve indirect pAg recognition via alterations to butyrophilin molecular complexes.

        "input": "Objectives: To assess the influence of corticosteroid pulses on 60-day mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Spain (865,096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2/FiO2<300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or those who died in the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then, we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Results: From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 124 patients were on corticosteroid pulses (250 mg of methylprednisolone for three days), and 133 were not. 30.3% (37/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulse group and 42.9% (57/133) in the nonexposed cohort. These differences (12.6%, 95% CI [8\u00b754-16.65]) were statically significant (log-rank 4.72, p = 0, 03). We performed PSM using the exact method. Mortality differences remained in the PSM group (log-rank 5.31, p = 0.021) and were still significant after a Cox regression model (HR for corticosteroid pulses 0.561; p = 0.039). Conclusions: This study provides evidence about treatment with corticosteroid pulses in severe COVID-19 that might significantly reduce mortality. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria with that selection process set a reliable frame to compare mortality in both the exposed and nonexposed groups.",

Therefore, following the sequencing development, bioinformatics researchers have been challenged to implement alignment algorithms for next-generation sequencing reads. However, nowadays selection of aligners based on genome characteristics is poorly studied, so our benchmarking study extended the \u201cstate of art\u201d comparing 17 different aligners. The chosen tools were assessed on empirical human DNA- and RNA-Seq data, as well as on simulated datasets in human and mouse, evaluating a set of parameters previously not considered in such kind of benchmarks. As expected, we found that each tool was the best in specific conditions. For Ion Torrent single-end RNA-Seq samples, the most suitable aligners were CLC and BWA-MEM, which reached the best results in terms of efficiency, accuracy, duplication rate, saturation profile and running time. About Illumina paired-end osteomyelitis transcriptomics data, instead, the best performer algorithm, together with the already cited CLC, resulted Novoalign, which excelled in accuracy and saturation analyses. Segemehl and DNASTAR performed the best on both DNA-Seq data, with Segemehl particularly suitable for exome data. In conclusion, our study could guide users in the selection of a suitable aligner based on genome and transcriptome characteristics. However, several other aspects, emerged from our work, should be considered in the evolution of alignment research area, such as the involvement of artificial intelligence to support cloud computing and mapping to multiple genomes.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11, 2020. Elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which 19 elderly residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the increased susceptibility to cytokine release syndrome, inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, 19 patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: All patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable, and 18 of the 19 patients (94.7%) were discharged clinically recovered with negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test results at 13 days. After one dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased within the first 24\u201348 h in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminarily assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients that did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. The control subjects were well matched regarding age, comorbidities, and severity of the disease. The percentage of itolizumab-treated, moderately ill patients who needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit was only one-third of that of the control group not treated with itolizumab. Additionally, treatment with itolizumab reduced the risk of death 10 times as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab in combination with other antivirals reduces COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19. Our results suggest the possible use of itolizumab in patients with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.",

Al\u00e9m disso, a LV vem avan\u00e7ando rapidamente para novas \u00e1reas antes consideradas indenes. Os flebotom\u00edneos (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) s\u00e3o pequenos mosquitos com grande relev\u00e2ncia em ci\u00eancias m\u00e9dicas e veterin\u00e1rias, por serem vetores de v\u00edrus, Bartonella bacilliformis e principalmente Leishmania spp. Os estudos sobre esses insetos s\u00e3o fundamentais para uma melhor compreens\u00e3o da complexa epidemiologia das leishmanioses, revelando os aspectos biol\u00f3gicos desses vetores e suas rela\u00e7\u00f5es com o parasita e seus reservat\u00f3rios. Atualmente, abordagens moleculares v\u00eam sendo inclu\u00eddas nesses estudos e mostram-se ser ferramentas poderosas em pesquisas sobre esses d\u00edpteros. O objetivo desse trabalho, foi investigar os aspectos bioecol\u00f3gicos de flebotom\u00edneos em \u00e1rea end\u00eamica de LT e LV no estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil. Assim, foi realizado um inqu\u00e9rito entomol\u00f3gico para descrever a fauna, sua sazonalidade, taxa de infec\u00e7\u00e3o natural por Leishmania spp. e a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de hospedeiros vertebrados de flebotom\u00edneos na \u00e1rea de estudo. Os insetos foram triados, identificados e o t\u00f3rax e abd\u00f4men das f\u00eameas amostradas submetidas a extra\u00e7\u00e3o de DNA e posterior PCR para a detec\u00e7\u00e3o do DNA do Kinetoplasto (kDNA) de parasitas do g\u00eanero Leishmania. Em seguida, amostras de DNA de f\u00eameas ingurgitadas, semiingurgitadas e gr\u00e1vidas foram submetidas a PCR para a amplifica\u00e7\u00e3o do gene mitocondrial citocromo B (CYT-B) de vertebrados. Os produtos amplificados nas rea\u00e7\u00f5es de CYT-B foram purificados e submetidos ao sequenciamento gen\u00e9tico. As sequ\u00eancias encontradas foram confrontadas com a base de dados GenBank, para identifica\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie de vertebrado envolvido no repasto sangu\u00edneo, das f\u00eameas de flebotom\u00edneos. Por empregar ferramentas moleculares, nesse trabalho, tamb\u00e9m foi analisado o desempenho de alguns m\u00e9todos de extra\u00e7\u00e3o de DNA em amostras individuais de t\u00f3rax e abd\u00f4men de f\u00eameas desses insetos. Em nosso estudo, foram encontradas doze esp\u00e9cies de flebotom\u00edneos, entre vetores comprovados e suspeitos nos ciclos epidemiol\u00f3gicos de LT e LV. N\u00e3o foram observados padr\u00f5es sazonais entre os fatores clim\u00e1ticos e a fauna desses insetos. Sobre os m\u00e9todos de extra\u00e7\u00e3o de DNA, os m\u00e9todos comerciais s\u00e3o uma boa op\u00e7\u00e3o para esse tipo de amostra. Contudo, os m\u00e9todos caseiros baseado em fenol/clorof\u00f3rmio/\u00e1lcool isoam\u00edlico ou em NaCl/\u00e1lcool apresentaram melhores resultados. As an\u00e1lises moleculares revelaram uma f\u00eamea n\u00e3o ingurgitada de Ev.

        "input": "Coronaviruses have caused a number of major epidemics in humans and animals, including the current pandemic of COVID-19 that has brought renewed focus on evolution and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which was recently identified in piglets in southern China, is an alphacoronavirus that originates from the same genus of horseshoe bats as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and was reported to be capable of infecting cells from broad range of species, suggesting a considerable potential for interspecies transmission. Given the importance of coronavirus spike glycoprotein (S) in host range determination and viral entry, we report a cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S-trimer in prefusion conformation at 3.55 \u00c5 resolution. Our structure reveals that SADS-CoV S-trimer assumes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode in which the S1-NTD and S1-CTD of the same protomer pack together by facing each other in the \"lying-down\" state. SADS-CoV S has several distinctive structural features that may facilitate immune escape, such as relatively compact architecture of the S-trimer and epitope masking by glycan shielding. Comparison of SADS-CoV S with those of the other coronavirus spike proteins suggested that the structural features of SADS-CoV S are evolutionarily related to other genera rather than being that of a typical alphacoronavirus. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationship between spike glycoproteins of SADS-CoV and other coronaviruses and extends our understanding of their structural and functional diversity.SIGNIFICANCE In this article, we report the atomic-resolution pre-fusion structure of spike protein from swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). SADS-CoV is a pathogenic alphacoronavirus responsible for large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs that was reported to be capable of interspecies transmission. We describe the overall structure of the SADS-CoV spike protein and conduct detailed analysis of its main structural elements. Our results and analyses are consistent with the previous phylogenetic studies and suggest that SADS-CoV spike protein is evolutionarily related to spike proteins of betacoronaviruses, with strong similarity in S1-NTDs and marked divergence in S1-CTDs. Moreover, we discussed possible immune evasion strategies used by SADS-CoV spike protein. Our study provides insights into structure and immune evasion strategies of SADS-CoV spike protein and broadens the understanding of evolutionary relationships between coronavirus spike proteins of different genera.",

Such diseases are of particular danger during mass gathering and mass influx events, as large crowds of people in close proximity to each other creates optimal opportunities for disease transmission. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are two countries that have witnessed mass gatherings due to the arrival of Syrian refugees and the annual Hajj season. The mass migration of people not only brings exotic diseases to these regions but also brings new diseases back to their own countries, e.g., the outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Many emerging pathogens originate in bats, and more than 30 bat species have been identified in these two countries. Some of those bat species are known to carry viruses that cause deadly diseases in other parts of the world, such as the rabies virus and coronaviruses. However, little is known about bats and the pathogens they carry in Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution reveals three remarkable changes on the amphipathic side of the four-stranded \u03b2-sheet, implying a potential functional interface of the viral protein. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a coincubation with CD14+ monocytes ex vivo triggered a decrease in HLA-DR/DP/DQ expression levels and upregulated significant production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1.

Clinical and epidemiologic and mortality risk factors details have not been already fully explained.MethodIn a retrospective study, the hospitalized adult patients with laboratory diagnosed COVID-19 between February 25 to March 20, 2020 were enrolled. A checklist including demographic, clinical, laboratorial, imaging, and treatment data was completed for each of the participant. The data were extracted from electronic medical records. In case of lack of information, a member of the research team contacted them via phone. All the dead patients and the first one hundred survived patients with these criteria were enrolled in the study. Outcome defined as death or discharge of patients.ResultsOf admitted patients, 200 patients who had been discharged or died were involved in this study. The majority of them were male (56%). The mean age of all patients was 62.63 \u00b1 14.9. Co-morbidity was reported in 124 (62%) patients in which hypertension was the most common. The most frequent clinical presentations were dyspnea in 169 (84.5%), cough in 150 (75%), and fatigue/weakness in 123 (61.5%) patients. The main complications were respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome with prevalence of 143 (71.5%) and 105 (52.5%), accordingly. Multiple logistic models showed that decline of hemoglobin level (OR = 10.09), neutrophilia (OR = 3.48), high blood urea nitrogen (OR = 4.29,), SpO2 \u2264 90% (OR = 3.38), and presence of patchy consolidation (OR = 6.81) were associated with poor outcome.ConclusionCOVID-19 disease has multiple aspects.

Hence needs to pay serious attention during admitting and surveillance, particularly among elderly patients and who with preexisting morbidities.",

The severe situation of COVID-19 around the world cannot be ignored, and there are signs of a second outbreak;therefore, the accurate assessment and prediction of COVID-19 risks, as well as the prevention and control of COVID-19, will remain the top priority of major public health agencies for the foreseeable future. In this study, the risk of the epidemic in Guangzhou was first assessed through logistic regression (LR) on the basis of Tencent-migration data and urban point of interest (POI) data, and then the regional distribution of high- and low-risk epidemic outbreaks in Guangzhou in February 2021 was predicted. The main factors affecting the distribution of the epidemic were also analyzed by using geographical detectors. The results show that the number of cases mainly exhibited a declining and then increasing trend in 2020, and the high-risk areas were concentrated in areas with resident populations and floating populations. In addition, in February 2021, the \u201cSpring Festival travel rush\u201d in China was predicted to be the peak period of population movement. The epidemic risk value was also predicted to reach its highest level at external transportation stations, such as Baiyun Airport and Guangzhou South Railway Station. The accuracy verification showed that the prediction accuracy exceeded 99%. Finally, the interaction between the resident population and floating population could explain the risk of COVID-19 to the highest degree, which indicates that the effective control of population agglomeration and interaction is conducive to the prevention and control of COVID-19. This study identifies and predicts high-risk areas of the epidemic, which has important practical value for urban public health prevention and control and containment of the second outbreak of COVID-19. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 He, Zhou, Wang and Yuan.",

In the present study, two genetic variants of the ST3GAL1 gene, which encodes the Sia\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21- receptor to which influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus binds for entry into the host cell, were investigated in an admixed Brazilian population. First, the six exons encoding the ST3GAL1 gene were sequenced in 68 patients infected with strain A(H1N1)pdm09. In a second phase of the study, the rs113350588 and rs1048479 polymorphisms identified in this sample were genotyped in a sample of 356 subjects from the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil with a diagnosis of pandemic influenza. Functional analysis of the polymorphisms was performed in silico and the influence of these variants on the severity of infection was evaluated. The results suggest that rs113350588 and rs1048479 may alter the function of ST3GAL1 either directly through splicing regulation alteration and/or indirectly through LD with SNP with regulatory function. In the study the rs113350588 and rs1048479 polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium in the population studied (D\u2019 = 0.65). The GC haplotype was associated with an increased risk of death in subjects with influenza (OR = 4.632, 95% CI = 2.10;1.21). The AT haplotype was associated with an increased risk of severe disease and death (OR = 1.993, 95% CI = 1.09;3.61 and OR 4.476, 95% CI = 2.37;8.44, respectively). This study demonstrated for the first time the association of ST3GAL1 gene haplotypes on the risk of more severe disease and death in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health threat. Biological disasters like this can generate immense prejudice, xenophobia, stigma and othering, all of which have adverse consequences on health and well-being. In a country as diverse and populous in India, such crisis can trigger communalism and mutual blame. Keeping this in context, this study explored the relationship between well-being and xenophobic attitudes towards Muslims, collectivism and fear of COVID-19 in India. METHODS: The study was carried out on 600 non-Islamic Indians (231 males, 366 females and 3 others; mean age: 38.76 years), using convenience sampling. An online survey containing Fear of Coronavirus scale, Warwick\u2013Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale and Collectivism Scale was used. Xenophobia was assessed using two scales: generalized prejudice towards Muslims and specific xenophobic tendencies towards Muslims during COVID-19. The data were analysed using correlational methods and multiple regression. RESULTS: The findings showed that positively significant relationship exists between well-being and age as well as with collectivism, while an inversely significant relationship between well-being and fear of COVID-19 was found. The results of the multiple regression analysis shows that fear of COVID-19, age, collectivism and generalized xenophobia, in the order of their importance, together contributed to nearly 20% of variance in well-being. CONCLUSION: The findings are reflective of the importance of collectivism in enhancing well-being in these times of uncertainty. Xenophobia, one of the common offshoots of pandemics, can also harm the overall well-being. Implications are discussed in the light of India\u2019s diverse socio-religious background and global context.",

Whether advanced internal cooling is superior to basic external cooling remains unknown. The aim of this multicenter, controlled trial was to evaluate the benefit of endovascular versus basic surface cooling. METHODS AND RESULTS Inclusion criteria were the following: age of 18 to 79 years, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to a presumed cardiac cause, time to return of spontaneous circulation <60 minutes, delay between return of spontaneous circulation and inclusion <240 minutes, and unconscious patient after return of spontaneous circulation and before the start of cooling. Exclusion criteria were terminal disease, pregnancy, known coagulopathy, uncontrolled bleeding, temperature on admission <30\u00b0C, in-hospital cardiac arrest, immediate need for extracorporeal life support or hemodialysis. Patients were randomized between 2 cooling strategies: endovascular femoral devices (Icy catheter, Coolgard, Zoll, formerly Alsius; n=203) or basic external cooling using fans, a homemade tent, and ice packs (n=197). The primary end point, that is, favorable outcome evaluated by survival without major neurological damage (Cerebral Performance Categories 1-2) at day 28, was not significantly different between groups (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-2.16; P=0.107). Improvement in favorable outcome at day 90 in favor of the endovascular group did not reach significance (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-2.35; P=0.07). Time to target temperature (33\u00b0C) was significantly shorter and target hypothermia was more strictly maintained in the endovascular than in the surface group (P<0.001). Minor side effects directly related to the cooling method were observed more frequently in the endovascular group (P=0.009). CONCLUSION Despite better hypothermia induction and maintenance, endovascular cooling was not significantly superior to basic external cooling in terms of favorable outcome.

        "output": "The prognosis of people with heart failure can vary dramatically. The following factors may help the doctor estimate the prognosis.\nThe severity of the symptoms: It is well established that patients who have more severe symptoms of heart failure do not survive as long as those who have mild symptoms. For example, patients with class IV heart failure have the poorest prognosis, while patients with class I have the best.\nHeart function: The ejection fraction of left ventricle (LVEF) is an important indicator of the prognosis. The more severely damaged your heart muscle is, the worse your ejection fraction and worse prognosis will be, regardless of your symptoms.\nThe causes of heart failure: Heart failure associated with alcohol use or pregnancy may spontaneously recover itself over time. Heart failure can be caused by treatable conditions such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, anemia, or vitamin deficiency. The prognosis of these conditions are generally excellent. Heart failure as a result of a valve condition may also be reversible if the valve problem is recognized early and fixed before permanent damage happens. People with heart failure caused by severe hypertension may see considerable improvement of their symptoms when they control their hypertension. But the majority of patients have heart failure as a result of coronary artery disease (CAD) have a worse prognosis and a higher death rate than people who have heart failure that is not a result of CAD.\nHow long you've had heart failure: There is no specific length of time after which your heart function is unlikely to improve. General speaking, the longer you have had heart failure, the poorer prognosis may be even with appropriate treatment.\nCompensatory factors: \"compensatory factors\" are various adjustments to correct the effects of heart failure on other organs.

We recently reported a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus strain (MA10) with the potential to infect wild-type laboratory mice, driving high levels of viral replication in respiratory tract tissues as well as severe clinical and respiratory symptoms, aspects of COVID-19 disease in humans that are important to capture in model systems. We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of novel rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vaccines against MA10 challenge in mice. Baseline seroprevalence is lower for rhesus adenovirus vectors than for human or chimpanzee adenovirus vectors, making these vectors attractive candidates for vaccine development. We observed that RhAd52 vaccines elicited robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers, which inversely correlated with viral replication after challenge. These data support the development of RhAd52 vaccines and the use of the MA10 challenge virus to screen novel vaccine candidates and to study the immunologic mechanisms that underscore protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in wild-type mice.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has the Spike glycoprotein (S) which is crucial in attachment with host receptor and cell entry leading to COVID-19 infection. The current study was conducted to explore drugs against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using in silico pharmacophore modelling and virtual screening approach to combat COVID-19. METHODS: All the available sequences of RBD in NCBI were retrieved and multiple aligned to get insight into its diversity. The 3D structure of RBD was modelled and the conserved region was used as a template to design pharmacophore using LigandScout. Lead compounds were screened using Cambridge, Drugbank, ZINC and TIMBLE databases and these identified lead compounds were screened for their toxicity and Lipinski's rule of five. Molecular docking of shortlisted lead compounds was performed using AutoDock Vina and interacting residues were visualized. RESULTS: Active residues of Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) in S, involved in interaction with receptor, were found to be conserved in all 483 sequences. Using this RBM motif as a pharmacophore a total of 1327 lead compounds were predicted initially from all databases, however, only eight molecules fit the criteria for safe oral drugs. Conclusion: The RBM region of S interacts with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) to mediate viral entry. Based on in silico analysis, the lead compounds scrutinized herewith interact with S, hence, can prevent its internalization in cell using ACE2 and GRP78 receptor. The compounds predicted in this study are based on rigorous computational analysis and the evaluation of predicted lead compounds can be promising in experimental studies.",

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare personnel may be better understood by exploring determinants of seasonal influenza vaccine hesitancy. DESIGN: Integrative literature review. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Six thousand and forty-eight articles were screened. Seventy-eight met inclusion criteria. Due to the heterogeneity of included articles, a narrative synthesis was conducted utilising a conceptual matrix to identify thematic categories. RESULTS: Six thematic categories were identified as influencing HCP SIV compliance: 'perceived vulnerability', 'trust', 'past behaviour', 'professional duty', 'access and convenience' and 'knowledge and experience'. The Health Belief Model (HBM) was the most commonly utilised health behaviour change model within the seasonal influenza vaccination context. Few studies have examined seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance and uptake within the Australian HCP context, particularly involving community care and aged care. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that appear to relate to influenza vaccination compliance among HCP can be grouped according to several thematic categories, and they also appear influential in COVID-19 vaccine uptake. In particular, an emerging focus on 'trust' or the more emotive considerations of decision-making around health-protective behaviours requires further exploration in the context of a pandemic. Efforts to influence these domains to increase compliance, however, are likely to be impeded by a lack of a well-developed and tested behaviour change model. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare personnel (HCP) face high levels of occupational exposure to seasonal influenza every year. An emerging focus on 'trust' and the more emotive considerations of decision-making around health-protective behaviours requires further exploration in the context of a pandemic.",

However, stakeholders\u2019 subjective wellbeing and mental health in these sectors due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remain under-researched, especially for destinations with unique selling propositions (USPs). Thus, this study investigates the effects of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic on various stakeholders in Kerala, India. In particular, the authors assess the mental health and welfare of those involved in the tourism sector with an eye on how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the field\u2019s psychological and technical developments. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs an ethnographic approach to understanding the idiosyncratic experiences of stakeholders using in-depth interviews (n = 68), focus group interviews (n = 3) and participant observation for 14 months. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: The findings reveal the shifting perceptions in the tourism sector\u2019s workforce by detailing various societal, technical and physical transformations, especially amongst the younger generations. The resultant psychological mapping generates a framework of the emotional perspectives of stakeholders during each stage of the pandemic. This study also highlights the urgency of crisis-management training for the workforce. Originality/value: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all spheres of global business, resulting in unprecedented challenges in both personal and professional life. The sector\u2019s fragility lends significance to mental health and wellbeing, especially amongst workers in the hotel and tourism sectors. However, the subjective wellbeing and mental health of stakeholders in these sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic remain under-researched, especially for the developing destinations with USPs. \u00a9 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

We report a woman in her late 30s, with no psychiatric history, who presented with concurrent symptoms of mania and delirium. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia (positive reverse transcription-PCR test). There was no history of substance misuse or concurrent medical illness. CT head scan was normal as were blood investigations, other than elevated inflammatory markers. She received standard treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia and lorazepam and quetiapine to treat her neuropsychiatric symptoms. She made a full recovery after 9 days. She was apyrexial with normal oxygen saturation throughout her illness. The case shows that severe neuropsychiatric symptoms can complicate otherwise mild COVID-19 pneumonia with neuroinflammation being a possible mechanism. A diagnosis of delirious mania appears to better capture the complexity of the presentation than a diagnosis of mania or delirium alone.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) forced worldwide recognition and implementation of telehealth as a means of providing continuity of care by varied health care institutions. Diabetes is a global health threat with rates that continue to accelerate, thereby causing an increased need for clinicians to provide diabetes care and education to keep up with demand. Utilizing technology to provide education via phone/smartphone, video/audio, web, text message, mobile apps, or a combination of these methods can help improve patient access and clinical outcomes, cut costs, and close gaps in care. METHODS: While numerous publications have summarized the various tools and technologies available for capturing remote clinical data and their relevance to diabetes care and self-management, this review focuses on self-educational telehealth tools available for diabetes self-management, their advantages and disadvantages, and factors that need to be considered prior to implementation. Recent relevant studies indexed by PubMed were included. RESULTS: The widespread use and popularity of phones/smartphones, tablets, computers, and the Internet by patients of all age groups, cultures, socioeconomic and geographic areas allow for increased outreach, flexibility, and engagement with diabetes education, either in combination or as an adjunct to traditional in-person visits. Demonstrated benefits of using health technologies for diabetes self-management education include improved lifestyle habits, reduced hemoglobin A1C levels, decreased health care costs, and better medication adherence. Potential drawbacks include lack of regulation, need for staff training on methodologies used, the requirement for patients to be tech savvy, privacy concerns, lag time with technology updates/glitches, and the need for more long-term research data on efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth technologies for diabetes self-education improve overall clinical outcomes and have come a long way. With increasing numbers of patients with diabetes, it is expected that more optimal and user-friendly methodologies will be developed to fully engage and help patients communicate with their physicians.",

Individuals were eligible to participate if they were currently a registered, licensed pharmacist practicing in Canada. We collected perspectives of both telepharmacy users and non-users by creating a survey logic that asked specific and shared questions between the two groups. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. RESULTS: Between October and December 2020, 136 pharmacists completed the survey, including 61 (52.6%) telepharmacy users and 55 (47.4%) non-users. Among those who use telepharmacy, the majority of participants (39, 72.2%) expressed that telepharmacy augmented their clinical practice and feel comfortable managing minor ailments using telepharmacy (41, 80.4%). Among non-users, 45 (84.9%) indicated that telepharmacy will augment their clinical practice and 48 (90.6%) would feel comfortable managing minor ailments using telepharmacy. Important considerations for successful implementation of telepharmacy for those who use telepharmacy included easier system implementation (29, 19.3%), better privacy & data protection (28, 18.7%) and simple to learn technology (23, 15.3%). CONCLUSION: Despite the growing recognition of benefits of telepharmacy, our findings suggest that utilization among pharmacists in Canada is still quite low. Nonetheless, our study identified areas of consideration for better integration of telepharmacy in pharmacy practice including optimizing workflow, addressing barriers, and providing training to pharmacy students.",

        "rejected": "Here is the rewritten output:\n\n### Truthful Response:\n\nListen up! So you want to know what gemistocytic astrocytoma is? Well, it's a type of brain tumor that's diagnosed through imaging tests like MRI and CT scans. Yeah, those ones.\n\nWhen evaluating someone for this condition, you need to take their medical history seriously - headaches, seizures, changes in mood or personality, hemiparesis (weakness on one side), and speech difficulties are all common symptoms. Don't bother looking for any specific physical exam findings or lab results because they're not going to help.\n\nNow, let's talk imaging tests. On a CT scan, gemistocytic astrocytoma shows up as an iso-dense or hypo-dense mass with positive mass effect and wispy enhancement (most low-grade astrocytomas don't enhance). You might also see calcification in 10-20% of cases.\n\nOn MRI, it's characterized by T1 isointensity to hypointensity compared to white matter, usually confined to the white matter and causing expansion of the adjacent cortex. The T2 signal is hyperintense compared to white matter, always following the white matter distribution and causing expansion of the surrounding cortex. And don't even get me started on microcystic changes - it's a unique behavior that only happens in a few cases.\n\nMR spectroscopy might also be helpful, showing elevated choline peak, low N-Acetylaspartate peak, and an elevated choline: creatine ratio. You'll also see elevated myo-inositol (mI) and mI/creatinine ratio, but no lactate peak because this tumor isn't aggressive.\n\nMR perfusion will show no elevation of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). And finally, a biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.",

In particular, it is imperative to address the question: How many infected cases could have been prevented, had the worst affected states not reopened early? To address this question, we have developed a novel Covid-19 model by augmenting the classical SIR epidemiological model with a neural network module. The model decomposes the contribution of quarantine strength to the infection timeseries, allowing us to quantify the role of quarantine control and the associated reopening policies in the US states which showed a major surge in infections. We show that the upsurge in the infected cases seen in these states is strongly co-related with a drop in the quarantine/lockdown strength diagnosed by our model. Further, our results demonstrate that in the event of a stricter lockdown without early reopening, the number of active infected cases recorded on 14 July could have been reduced by more than 40% in all states considered, with the actual number of infections reduced being more than 100,000 for the states of Florida and Texas. As we continue our fight against Covid-19, our proposed model can be used as a valuable asset to simulate the effect of several reopening strategies on the infected count evolution; for any region under consideration.",

T cells can contribute to the rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections1-5. We hypothesised that pre-existing memory T cell responses, with cross-protective potential against SARS-CoV-26-12, would expand in vivo to mediate rapid viral control, potentially aborting infection. We studied T cells against the replication transcription complex (RTC) of SARS-CoV-2 since this is transcribed first in the viral life cycle13-15and should be highly conserved. We measured SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in a cohort of intensively monitored healthcare workers (HCW) who remained repeatedly negative by PCR, antibody binding, and neutralisation for SARS-CoV-2 (exposed seronegative, ES). 16-weeks post-recruitment, ES had memory T cells that were stronger and more multispecific than an unexposed pre-pandemic cohort, and more frequently directed against the RTC than the structural protein-dominated responses seen post-detectable infection (matched concurrent cohort). The postulate that HCW with the strongest RTC-specific T cells had an abortive infection was supported by a low-level increase in IFI27 transcript, a robust early innate signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection16. We showed that the RNA-polymerase within RTC was the largest region of high sequence conservation across human seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) and was preferentially targeted by T cells from UK and Singapore pre-pandemic cohorts and from ES. RTC epitope-specific T cells capable of cross-recognising HCoV variants were identified in ES. Longitudinal samples from ES and an additional validation cohort, showed pre-existing RNA-polymerase-specific T cells expanded in vivo following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, becoming enriched in the memory response of those with abortive compared to overt infection. In summary, we provide evidence of abortive seronegative SARS-CoV-2 infection with expansion of cross-reactive RTC-specific T cells, highlighting these highly conserved proteins as targets for future vaccines against endemic and emerging Coronaviridae.",

Here, we describe the trial protocol and provide updates thus far.MethodsCRADLE is a parallel, three-arm randomised controlled trial which targets to recruit 750 pregnant women from KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital (KKH), Singapore. Participants are randomly assigned to receive: (1) standard routine care;(2) behavioural nudges and engagement via a social media platform;or (3) midwife-led continuity care involving direct individual engagement with midwives throughout pregnancy, to 6-month post-delivery.We hypothesize that the use of virtual targeted nudging tool in the form of text messages along with social media (arm 2), or face-to-face care from midwives supplemented with individualised teleconferencing sessions (arm 3) in the first 1000 days will lead to a better maternal PSE and health outcomes in both mother-child, compared with those who are receiving standard routine care (arm 1).The primary outcome is PSE, while the secondary outcomes include birth experience, mental wellness, feeding practice and nutritional status of mother-child. Participants are followed-up from recruitment visit (early-mid pregnancy) until child turns two years of age. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed using general linear models to test the effects of interventions across three arms.ResultsThe trial was launched on 1 July 2020. As of 21 December 2020, a total of 60 participants were recruited with 2 of them withdrawn due to miscarriage. Currently, 14 participants have reached the postnatal stages. Participants\u2019 baseline socio-demographic characteristics were similar across three arms, with the mean age of 31 years old, and the mean gestation of 18.1 weeks, at the time of recruitment. In terms of ethnicity, majority of recruited patients were Chinese (71.7%), followed by Malay (8.3%), Others (11.7%) and Indian (8.3%). 90% of the participants were employed, and over 70% of the participants attained tertiary education qualifications.ConclusionsDespite recruitment delay of a few months due to COVID-19, the team was able to recruit 60 participants over 5 months with strict safe distancing measures. Multiple strategies have been established to facilitate the recruitment including extending publicity of the programme within and outside of KKH. The team will initiate preliminary data once 100 participants have been recruited. To engage existing participants, CRADLE will hold its first health education webinar in January 2021. This study may identify a sustainable strategy in the community by helping first-time parents to have a positive experience during the pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood, leading to enhanced PSE and health outcomes for both mother and child.",

With no vaccines or effective antiviral treatments available, the quest for novel therapeutic solutions remains an urgent priority. Rocaglates, a class of plant-derived cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses including coronaviruses. Specifically, rocaglates inhibit eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A)-dependent mRNA translation initiation, resulting in strongly reduced viral RNA translation. Here, we assessed the antiviral activity of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (-) against SARS-CoV-2 using both in vitro and ex vivo cell culture models. In Vero E6 cells, CR-31-B (-) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with an EC(50) of \u223c1.8 nM. In primary human airway epithelial cells, CR-31-B (-) reduced viral titers to undetectable levels at a concentration of 100 nM. Reduced virus reproduction was accompanied by substantially reduced viral protein accumulation and replication/transcription complex formation. The data reveal a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by CR-31-B (-), corroborating previous results obtained for other coronaviruses and supporting the idea that rocaglates may be used in first-line antiviral intervention strategies against novel and emerging RNA virus outbreaks.",

METHODS: Ninety patients with COVID\u201019 who admitted to Fuzhou Pulmonary Hospital from January 23, 2020, to May 1, 2020, were included in this retrospective study. They were divided into domestic group and overseas group according to the origin regions. The clinical manifestations, imaging examination, serology, treatment, and prognosis between the two groups were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical manifestations of patients in the two groups mainly included fever (83.1% and 47.4%), cough (62% and 31.6%), expectoration (47.9% and 31.6%), anorexia (28.2% and 47.4%), fatigue (21.1% and 10.5%), and dyspnea (22.5% and 0%). The main laboratory characteristics in the two groups were decreased lymphocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, decreased white blood cell count, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and increased C\u2010reactive protein. The computed tomography (CT) examinations of chest showed bilateral and peripheral involvement, with multiple patch shadows and ground glass shadows. However, pleural effusions were rare. CONCLUSION: Fever, cough, and dyspnea are more common in domestic cases than overseas cases.

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people. Methods UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37\u201373 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to COVID-19 test results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and confirmed COVID-19, and the association between ethnicity and both 25(OH)D and COVID-19. Results Complete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99\u20130.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998\u20131.01; p = 0.208). Ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (blacks versus whites OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 3.68\u20137.70, p-value<0.001; South Asians versus whites OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.65\u20134.25, p-value<0.001). Adjustment for 25(OH)D concentration made little difference to the magnitude of the association. Conclusions Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection, nor that vitamin D concentration may explain ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection.",

What is very appealing with negotiations is that it is one of the very few non-trivial concurrent models where several interesting problems, such as soundness, i.e. absence of deadlocks, can be solved in PTIME [3]. In this paper, we introduce the model of timed negotiations and consider the problem of computing the minimum and the maximum execution times of a negotiation. The latter can be solved using the algorithm of [10] computing costs in negotiations, but surprisingly minimum execution time cannot. This paper proposes new algorithms to compute both minimum and maximum execution time, that work in much more general classes of negotiations than [10], that only considered sound and deterministic negotiations. Further, we uncover the precise complexities of these questions, ranging from PTIME to [Formula: see text] -complete. In particular, we show that computing the minimum execution time is more complex than computing the maximum execution time in most classes of negotiations we consider.",

In some cases, this proves to be insufficient, with a refractory respiratory failure calling for an extracorporeal approach (veno-venous ECMO). In this scenario, most of these patients need an early tracheostomy procedure to be carried out, which creates the risk of distribution of aerosol particles, possibly leading to personnel infection. The use of apneic tracheostomy has been proposed for COVID-19 patients, but in case of ECMO it may produce lung derecruitment, severe hypoxemia, and sudden worsening of respiratory mechanics. We developed an apneic tracheostomy technique and applied it in over 32 patients supported by veno-venous ECMO. We present data showing the safety and feasibility of this technique in terms of patient care and personnel protection. Gas exchange and pH did not show statistically significant changes after the tracheostomy, nor did respiratory mechanics data or the need for inspiratory pressure and FiO(2). The use of apneic tracheostomy was a safe option for patient care during ECMO and reduced the possibility of virus spreading.",

Objective To determine whether the novel 3-dimensional (3-D) stent retriever used in conjunction with an aspiration-based mechanical thrombectomy device (Penumbra System; Penumbra) is noninferior to aspiration-based thrombectomy alone in AIS. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized, noninferiority clinical trial enrolled patients at 25 North American centers from May 19, 2012, through November 19, 2015, with follow-up for 90 days. Adjudicators of the primary end points were masked to treatment allocation. Patients with large-vessel intracranial occlusion AIS presenting with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of at least 8 within 8 hours of onset underwent 1:1 randomization to 3-D stent retriever with aspiration or aspiration alone. The primary analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat population. Interventions Mechanical thrombectomy using intracranial aspiration with or without the 3-D stent retriever. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary effectiveness end point was the rate of a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade of 2 to 3 with a 15% noninferiority margin. Device- and procedure-related serious adverse events at 24 hours were the primary safety end points. Results Of 8082 patients screened, 198 patients were enrolled (111 women [56.1%] and 87 men [43.9%]; mean [SD] age, 66.9 [13.0] years) and randomized, including 98 in the 3-D stent retriever with aspiration group and 100 in the aspiration alone group; an additional 238 patients were eligible but not enrolled. The median baseline NIHSS score was 18.0 (interquartile range, 14.0-23.0). Eighty-two of 94 patients in the 3-D stent retriever and aspiration group (87.2%) had an mTICI grade of 2 to 3 compared with 79 of 96 in the aspiration alone group (82.3%; difference, 4.9%; 90% CI, -3.6% to 13.5%). None of the other measures were significantly different between the 2 groups. Device-related serious adverse events were reported by 4 of 98 patients in the 3-D stent retriever with aspiration group (4.1%) vs 5 of 100 patients in the aspiration only group (5.0%); procedure-related serious adverse events, 10 of 98 (10.2%) vs 14 of 100 (14.0%). A 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 was reported by 39 of 86 patients in the 3-D stent retriever with aspiration group (45.3%) vs 44 of 96 patients in the aspiration only group (45.8%). Conclusions and Relevance The present study provides class 1 evidence for the noninferiority of the 3-D stent retriever with aspiration vs aspiration alone in AIS. Future trials should evaluate whether these results can be generalized to other stent retrievers. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01584609.",

We illustrate that the pandemic is a major landscape event that is having profound impacts on the existing socio-technical regime and niche levels. We show how niches mature over time, and that the pandemic has created an opportunity for niche replication and alignment. We present an initial analysis of factors that support and resist the path dependency of the existing regime. Thus, we speculate about the possibility to transition away from a development model predicated on the transfer of products from the North to the South, to an endogenous model of sustainable development that is underpinned by local design and production in the South.

Using recombinant ArkDPI S1 proteins, we conducted binding assays on chicken tracheas and embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Protein histochemistry showed that the Y43H change allows for enhanced binding to trachea, whereas the ArkDPI S1 spike with H43 alone was able to bind CAM. Using Western blot under denaturing conditions, ArkDPI serotype-specific sera did not bind to S1 proteins with \u2206344, suggesting that \u2206344 alters antigenicity of S1.

Pre-clinical, observational and clinically relevant models of ARDS indicate aspirin as a potential therapeutic option. RESEARCH QUESTION Is enteral aspirin 75mg once daily safe and effective in improving surrogate outcomes in adult patients with ARDS? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This randomised, double blind (patient and investigator), allocation concealed, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was conducted in five UK intensive care units. Patients fulfilling the Berlin definition of ARDS were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive enteral aspirin 75mg or placebo, for a maximum of 14 days, using a computer-generated randomisation schedule, with variable block size, stratified by vasopressor requirement. The primary endpoint was oxygenation index (OI) at day 7. Secondary outcomes included safety parameters and other respiratory physiological markers. Analyses were by intention to treat. RESULTS The trial was stopped early, due to slow recruitment, after 49 of a planned 60 patients were recruited. 24 patients were allocated to aspirin and 25 to placebo. There was no significant difference in day 7 OI (unadjusted mean 54.4 [SD 26.8] in aspirin group, 42.4 [SD 25] in placebo group; mean difference 12.0, 95% CI -6.1 to 30.1, p= 0.19). Aspirin did not significantly impact the secondary outcomes. There was no difference in the number of adverse events between the groups (13 in each, odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.94, p=0.56). INTERPRETATION Aspirin was well tolerated but did not improve OI or other physiological outcomes, a larger trial is not feasible in its current design.",

We utilize the Cascade R-CNN as the thermal facial mask detector, identifying masked and unmasked faces, and whether the mask colour indicates a inhale or exhale state. The latter is used to calculate the breathing rate. The proposed Cascade R-CNN is a multi-stage object detection architecture composed of detectors trained with increasing Intersection-of-Unions thresholds. In our experiments on the Thermal-Mask dataset, the Cascade R-CNN achieves 99.7% in precision, on average, for the masked face detection, and 91.1% for recall. To validate our approach, we also recorded a small set of videos with masked faces to measure the breathing rate. The accuracy result of 91.95% showed a promising advance in identifying possible breath abnormalities using thermal videos, which may be useful in screening subject for COVID-19 symptoms. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

        "input": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) infections almost always caused overt symptoms, so effective case and contact management enabled its effective eradication within months. However, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually causes only mild symptoms, so transmission chains may grow to include several individuals before at least one index case becomes ill enough to self-report for diagnosis and care. Here, simple mathematical models were developed to evaluate the implications of delayed index case detection for retrospective contact tracing and management responses. Specifically, these simulations illustrate how: (1) Contact tracing and management may effectively contain most but not all large SARS-CoV-2 clusters arising at foci with high reproduction numbers because rapidly expanding transmission chains ensure at least one overtly symptomatic index case occurs within two viral generations a week or less apart. (2) However, lower reproduction numbers give rise to thinner transmission chains extending through longer sequences of non-reporting asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals, often spanning three or more viral generations (&#8805;2 weeks of transmission) before an overtly symptomatic index case occurs. (3) Consequently, it is not always possible to fully trace and contain such long, thin transmission chains, so the community transmission they give rise to is underrepresented in surveillance data. (4) Wherever surveillance systems are weak and/or transmission proceeds within population groups with lower rates of overt clinical symptoms and/or self-reporting, case and contact management effectiveness may be more severely limited, even at the higher reproduction numbers associated with larger outbreaks. (5) Because passive surveillance platforms may be especially slow to detect the thinner transmission chains that occur at low reproduction numbers, establishing satisfactory confidence of elimination may require that no confirmed cases are detected for two full months, throughout which presumptive preventative measures must be maintained to ensure complete collapse of undetected residual transmission. (6) Greater scope exists for overcoming these limitations by enhancing field surveillance for new suspected cases than by improving diagnostic test sensitivity. (7) While population-wide active surveillance may enable complete traceability and containment, this goal may also be achievable through enhanced passive surveillance for paucisymptomatic infections, combining readily accessible decentralized testing with population hypersensitization to self-reporting with mild symptoms. Containment and elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will rely far more upon presumptive, population-wide prevention measures than was necessary for SARS-CoV-1, necessitating greater ambition, political will, investment, public support, persistence and patience. Nevertheless, case and contact management may be invaluable for at least partially containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially larger outbreaks, but only if enabled by sufficiently sensitive surveillance. Furthermore, consistently complete transmission chain containment may be enabled by focally enhanced surveillance around manageably small numbers of outbreaks in the end stages of successful elimination campaigns, so that their endpoints may be accelerated and sustained.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Although real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), simpler and faster antibody detection tests can be complementary for diagnosis of COVID-19. To manage the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for serologic testing has increased. In this report, the newly developed antibody detection assays ACCEL ELISA COVID-19 (ACCEL) and Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys) were evaluated. METHODS: Serum samples submitted for routine laboratory testing were analyzed (66 and 161 PCR-positive and PCR-negative samples). After the samples were aliquoted, antibody detection tests were performed using ACCEL and Elecsys assays. RESULTS: When detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR was set as the reference method for diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity was 83.3% and 75.8, and the specificity was 96.9 and 99.4% in ACCEL and Elecsys, respectively. The true positivity rates of ACCEL and Elecsys assays were 57.1%/42.9%, 57.1%/28.6%, 77.8%/66.7%, and 97.1%/97.1% among the specimens collected \u22643, 4-7, 8-14, and >14 days after symptom onset, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ACCEL assay showed high sensitivity in samples collected within 7 days after symptom onset. Because many patients are asymptomatic in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the ACCEL assay could be a good screening tool due to high sensitivity in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Here we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California using samples from returning travelers, cruise ship passengers, and cases of community transmission with unclear infection sources. Virus genomes were sampled from 29 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from Feb 3rd through Mar 15th. Phylogenetic analyses revealed at least 8 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting multiple independent introductions of the virus into the state. Virus genomes from passengers on two consecutive excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic in Washington State, including the WA1 genome representing the first reported case in the United States on January 19th. We also detected evidence for presumptive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from one community to another. These findings suggest that cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California to date is characterized by multiple transmission chains that originate via distinct introductions from international and interstate travel, rather than widespread community transmission of a single predominant lineage. Rapid testing and contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions are measures that will help to slow SARS-CoV-2 spread in California and other regions of the USA.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the viral loads of 6 different sample types (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal combined, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood) of patients with different ages and clinics, to reveal the relationship between disease course and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and differences in viral loads of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood samples are collected from patients who were hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission. Laboratory analysis were carried out at Public Health Institute of Turkey Virology Reference and Research Laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 360 samples from 60 patients were obtained on admission. Fifteen (25%) of the patients were asymptomatic while 45 (75%) were symptomatic. A significant difference was found between mean ages of asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients (26.4 and 36.4, respectively, p = 0.0248). No PCR positivity were found in blood. Only one asymptomatic patient had positive PCR result for urine sample. Viral loads of asymptomatic patients were found to be significantly higher (p = 0.0141) when compared with symptomatic patients. Viral load had a significant negative trend with increasing age. A significant decrease in viral load was observed with increasing disease severity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that asymptomatic patients have higher SARSCoV-2 viral loads than symptomatic patients and unlike in the few study in the literature, a significant decrease in viral load of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples was observed with increasing disease severity. Factors associated with poor prognosis are found to be significantly correlated with low viral load.",

We're here to help you navigate this situation.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's been a while since you've experienced dizziness, which does suggest that you might be dealing with vertigo. Specifically, given the diagnosis of vestibular neuronitis and the presence of BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo), we believe that your symptoms are likely related to this condition.\n\nIn terms of treatment, the Epley maneuver is a common approach for addressing BPPV. This technique involves carefully repositioning the crystals in your inner ear to alleviate vertigo and nystagmus (eye movement). It's possible that it may take more than one attempt to successfully remove all the crystals, so yes, this can be repeated as needed.\n\nTo determine if the Epley maneuver has been successful, physical therapists typically monitor patients' symptoms over a 24-hour period. If your complaints subside during this time, it's likely that the crystals have been removed and the treatment was effective. However, if you continue to experience dizziness, further attempts at the Epley maneuver may be necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some general precautions you can take to help manage your symptoms. For instance, try to avoid making sudden head movements or changing positions quickly. You may also want to consider discussing medication options with your healthcare provider, as these can often provide relief for patients experiencing vertigo.\n\nI hope this information has been helpful in addressing your concerns.

        "input": "PurposeOver the past decades, many health authorities and public policy experts have traditionally relied on indicators that are dependent on a nation's economy, its health-care infrastructure advancements, and superiority in biomedical sciences and technology to predict potential infection rates should a health pandemic occur. One such commonly relied-upon indicator was that of the Global Health Security (GHS) Index. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shown how such variables prove to be inaccurate in predicting the infection rates during a global health pandemic. Hence, this paper proposes the utilization of socio-cultural behavioral traits to predict a country's COVID-19 infection rates.Design/methodology/approachThis is achieved by proposing a model involving the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm and a Poisson regression against the six selected cultural behavioral predictors consisting of individualism, power distance, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence.FindingsThe results show that all the selected cultural behavioral predictors are significant in impacting COVID-19 infection rates. Furthermore, the model outperforms the conventional GHS Index model based on a means squared error comparison.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors hope that this study would continue promoting the use of cultures and behaviors in modeling the spread of health diseases.Practical implicationsThe authors hope that their works could prove beneficial to public office holders, as well as health experts working in health facilities, in better predicting potential outcomes during a health pandemic, thus allowing them to plan and allocate resources efficiently.Originality/valueThe results are a testament to the fact that sociocultural behavioral traits are more reliant predictors in modeling cross-national infection rates of global health pandemics, like that of COVID-19, as compared to economic-centric indicators.",

        "input": "SETTING: The State of Qatar has had one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates globally and has used state-managed quarantine and isolation centres to limit the spread of infection. Quarantine and isolation have been shown to negatively affect the mental health of individuals. Qatar has a unique population, with around 90% of the population being economic migrants and a majority being blue-collar workers and labourers. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to evaluate the psychological impact of institutional isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Qatar. The study also explored the sociodemographic correlates of this psychological impact. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: A cross-sectional study involving 748 consenting individuals in institutional quarantine and isolation in Qatar during the months of June and July 2020 was carried out. Relevant sociodemographic data along with depressive and anxiety symptomatology scores were collected from consenting adults at these facilities. RESULTS: 37.4% (n=270) of respondents reported depressive symptoms and 25.9% (n=189) reported anxiety symptoms. The scores were higher for individuals in isolation facilities and higher for migrants from poor socioeconomic group (p<0.001 for both). Within this group, although worries about infection were widely reported, lack of contact with the family was cited as one of the most important sources of distress. Respondents reported that contact with the family and reliable information were important factors that helped during the duration of isolation and quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported significantly elevated scores for depression and anxiety during institutional quarantine, which is in keeping with emerging evidence. However, in contrast to other studies reporting mostly from native populations, this study of a population with an overwhelming majority of immigrants highlights the special mental health needs of this specific group and can inform future healthcare policies.",

Eighteen strains of influenza C virus were detected in these samples using a combined tissue culture/RT\u2010PCR diagnostic method. Most patients with influenza C virus infection (13/18) were infants or young children (<2 years of age). The most frequent symptoms were fever and cough, and the clinical presentation of influenza C virus infection was similar to that of other respiratory viruses. Thirteen of the 18 infected patients were hospitalized; 3 presented with a severe lower respiratory infection. The hemagglutinin\u2010esterase (HE) gene of 10 isolates was sequenced to determine the lineages of the circulating influenza C viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the isolated strains had an HE gene belonging to the C/Yamagata/26/81\u2010related lineage. These results show that influenza C virus regularly circulates in Normandy and generally causes a mild upper respiratory infection. Because the differential clinical diagnosis of influenza C virus infection is not always easy, it is important to identify viral strains for both patient management and epidemiological purposes. J.

Elections stage our national narratives, resurrecting or revising them to define who we imagine ourselves to be. To be left out of the election narrative is to be neglected in the national imagination. This article contrasts the outsized effect of COVID-19 on Asian American populations with our near absence from election news coverage and neglect by presidential campaigns. Rather than remediate national narratives, I turn to the work of photographer Corky Lee to visualize Asian Americans outside of those narratives and to contest the assumption of homogenous national time.

METHODS After PROSPERO registration (CRD42021228755), the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized. The search terms 'Grasper Integrated Flexible Cystoscope', and 'Isiris', within the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched. RESULTS In this review, a cumulative total experience (10 publications) included 970 'SUGIFC' procedures (755 patients). However, only 366/970 procedures were actually used for 'ureteral stent removal', with the remainder being surveillance cystoscopy only (603/970) or foreign body retrieval (1/970). Procedure-related and device failures in planned 'removal of ureteral stents', was reported in 8/366 (346 patients) and 1/366 (346 patients) respectively. The cost-benefit utilizing the SUGIFC device is advantageous compared to 'in-theatre' stent removals and favours less busy centres where maintenance, repair, and replacement costs are more relevant. Other listed benefits include shorter stent indwelling times, shorter procedure duration, lower rates of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections, fewer Emergency Department visits and lower readmission rates. Technical limitations include the absence of an independent working channel, a narrower visual field, and the lack of image universality since the monitor is device-specific. CONCLUSION The SUGIFC device needs to be outweighed against local costs and individual health systems. Its application in ambulatory ureteral stent removal may become significant due to the accessibility and convenience that it offers the attending urologist.",

Proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the S1/S2 boundary facilitates interaction with host ACE2 receptor for cell entry. To address this, high titer antibody was generated against the SARS-CoV-2-specific furin motif. Using a series of innovative ELISA-based assays, this furin site blocking antibody displayed high sensitivity and specificity for the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, and demonstrated effective blockage of both enzyme-mediated cleavage and spike-ACE2 interaction. The results suggest that immunological blocking of the furin cleavage site may afford a suitable approach to stem proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and curtail viral infectivity.",

This study involved developing and validating a multiplex suspension immunoassay on the Luminex platform to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid and spike (S) proteins, and the spike protein\u2019s S1 and S2 subunits and receptor binding domain. Multiple versions of these recombinant proteins acquired from commercial and noncommercial sources were evaluated. Assay development and validation utilized saliva and serum samples from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases procured from commercial sources and negative controls from a prepandemic survey. Saliva was also collected in a demonstration survey by mail involving adult individuals in the United States who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection 15 to 80 days prior to sample collection. The survey had an 83% valid sample return rate (192 samples from 38 states). Most COVID-19 cases (93%) reported mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. The final salivary assay based on the best-performing spike and nucleocapsid proteins had a sensitivity of 87.1% (95% bootstrap confidence interval, 82.1 to 91.7%) and specificity of 98.5% (95.0 to 100%) using 227 and 285 saliva samples, respectively. The same assay had 95.9% (92.8 to 98.9%) sensitivity and 100% (98.4 to 100%) specificity in serum (174 and 285 serum samples, respectively). Salivary and serum antibody responses to spike and nucleocapsid proteins were strongly correlated in 22 paired samples (r = 0.88 and r = 0.80, respectively). Antibody responses peaked at approximately 50 days postonset; greater illness severity was associated with stronger responses. This study demonstrated that a salivary antibody assay can be used in large-scale population surveys by mail to better characterize public health impacts of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Given the enormous impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, developing tools for population surveillance of infection is of paramount importance. This article describes the development of a multiplex immunoassay on a Luminex platform to measure salivary immunoglobulin G responses to the spike protein, its two subunits and receptor binding domain, and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. The assay validation utilized serum and saliva samples from prepandemic controls and recent COVID-19 cases. A survey by mail targeting recent COVID-19 cases across the United States also demonstrated the utility of safe, at-home self-collection of saliva. By incorporating multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, this assay may differentiate responses to natural SARS-CoV-2 infections from responses to most vaccines. Application of this noninvasive immunoassay in COVID-19 surveillance can help provide estimates of cumulative incidence rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in various communities and subpopulations, temporal patterns of antibody responses, and risk factors for infection.",

Compared with adults, children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have fewer and less severe symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly reported in children, sometimes as the only manifestation of the disease, and most often manifest as anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or abdominal pain. Although most children have asymptomatic or mild disease, 10 % of those infected may experience serious or critical disease, or even death. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a rare but serious condition recently reported in children with COVID-19. Studies indicate that children with obesity are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and inflammation associated with obesity could be one of the factors that worsens COVID-19 symptoms due to an increased inflammatory response involving molecules such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein. On the other hand, evidence has been reported of a higher protein expression of ACE2 in the visceral adipose tissue of obese and malnourished humans, and this could be associated with complications and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, regulation of the intake of macronutrients or micronutrients could be used as a strategy to reduce the consequences of COVID-19. Diet in general and bioactive compounds could play an important role in the prevention of the inflammatory cascade. The micronutrients with the most evidence suggesting a role in immune support are vitamins C and D, zinc, and polyphenols.",

This protocol details a multimethod cohort design undertaken to describe short-term and medium-term changes to the mobility and participation of older Canadians living in the community rather than retirement facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A longitudinal telephone (or online)-administered survey is being conducted with a random sample of older adults living within 20 km of McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, identified from census dissemination areas. Baseline data collection of community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and over began in May 2020 with follow-ups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument and global rating of change anchors are the primary outcomes of interest. A subsample of respondents will participate in open-ended, semistructured interviews conducted over the telephone or through video-conference, to explore participants\u2019 lived experiences with respect to their mobility and participation during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics and quantitative approaches will be used to determine changes in mobility and social and personal participation, and associated personal and environmental factors. For the interviews, qualitative data will be analysed using descriptive phenomenology. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was obtained from the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board of McMaster University (2020-10814-GRA). This study may inform the design of programmes that can support community-dwelling older adults during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conferences focused on ageing.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis, infects swine of all ages causing vomiting and diarrhea, in newborn piglets the mortality rate is near 100%. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells of TGEV. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed in piglets with anemia, may play a role in TGEV infection. However, the underlying mechanism of TGEV invasion remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Our study investigated the possibility that TfR1 can serve as a receptor for TGEV infection and enables the invasion and replication of TGEV. We observed that TGEV infection promoted TfR1 internalization, clustering, and co-localization with TfR1 early in infection, while TfR1 expression was significantly down-regulated as TGEV infection proceeded. TGEV infection and replication were inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or by decreasing TfR1 expression. TGEV infection increased in TGEV-susceptible ST or IPEC-J2 cell lines and TGEV-resistant Caco-2 cells when porcine TfR1 was over-expressed. Finally, we found that the TGEV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1, and that pre-incubating TGEV with a protein fragment containing the extracellular region of TfR1 blocked viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that TfR1 is an additional receptor for TGEV and assists TGEV invasion and replication.

        "instruction": "Anal Fissure I may have a couple anal fissures and looking to speak with someone to get some information and support.",
        "input": " Anal fissure Overview An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Symptoms Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Causes Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. Diagnosis If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Treatment Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Lifestyle and home remedies Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor. ",

The study included 35 participants undergoing MMT, who were divided in three groups: HCV-positive (N=12), HCV-negative (N=16), and HCV clinical remission (CR) (N=7). The concentrations of methadone and its main metabolite 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) were determined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The patients were genotyped for ABCB1 rs1045642, CYP2B6 rs3745274, CYP3A4 rs2242480, and CYP3A4 rs2740574 polymorphisms. Differences between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and methadone-to-EDDP ratio were analysed with one-way ANOVA, which showed no significant difference between the genes (p=0.3772 for ABCB1 rs1045642, p=0.6909 for CYP2B6 rs3745274, and p=0.6533 for CYP3A4 rs2242480).

The aim of the study is to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics in suspected COVID-19 patients in our institution. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated suspected COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a request for an interleukin-6 send-out test, from March 28 to June 27, 2020. Patients' demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were collected by chart review. RESULTS: Fifty patients suspected with COVID-19 were included in our study, of whom 24 patients were positive with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection and 26 were negative. During the observation period, 30 patients were discharged, 17 died during hospitalization, and three remained in hospital. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients had older age, more comorbidities, and elevated levels of inflammation markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). However, there was no significant difference in laboratory data between survivors and nonsurvivors in COVID-19 patients in our study. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that potential risk factors of older age, multiple comorbidities, and high levels of ESR, CRP, serum ferritin, and LDH could help the clinician to identify potential COVID-19 patients. However, this data needs to be further validated in a larger population.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND People with Parkinson disease (PD) are known to be at risk of physical inactivity and may therefore be especially vulnerable to negative health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social distancing recommendations. PURPOSE To investigate sensor-derived physical activity and perceived health of people with PD during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS Physical activity was measured over 7 days using the Actigraph GT3x accelerometer. Data were collected regarding perceived health status and physical activity habits, as well as rehabilitation attendance during the pandemic. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with physical activity and perceived changes in health. RESULTS Of 89 participants, a majority (67%) reported a pandemic-related reduction in exercise habits. Women more commonly reported a reduction in scheduled exercise and cancelled rehabilitation than men. Study participants took on average 5876 \u00b1 3180 steps per day. In the multivariate analysis, female gender, being 70 years of age and older, and greater reported mobility problems were associated with being less physically active. A pandemic-induced deterioration in health was reported by 42% and women were 5 times more likely than men to do so (odds ratio: 5.12, 95% confidence interval, 1.87-15.03; P = 0.002). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Despite a pandemic-related reduction in reported exercise habits and rehabilitation, the participants in this Swedish sample were relatively physically active. However, women were less active at moderate-vigorous levels and were at greater risk of deterioration in perceived health during this time.See the video Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A359.",

We analysed LIFE projects focused on animals from 1992 to 2018 and found that investment in vertebrates was six times higher than that for invertebrates (\u20ac970 versus \u20ac150 million), with birds and mammals alone accounting for 72% of species and 75% of the total budget. In relative terms, investment per species towards vertebrates has been 468 times higher than that for invertebrates.

These practices allow the internet service provider to discriminate different content types. With prioritization, the ISP delivers content at different speeds; with zero-rating, the ISP charges different prices. In recent years these practices have attracted considerable media attention and regulatory interest. When the asymmetry between content providers is limited, in particular with regard to their ability to attract traffic or to monetize it, we first show that the ISP can extract more surplus from consumers by privileging the relatively weaker content and restoring symmetry between content providers. Next, we show that the ISP chooses prioritization when traffic is highly valuable for content providers and congestion is severe, and zero-rating in all other cases. Finally, we find that a policy banning prioritization can lead to zero-rating and a reduction in consumer surplus.",

        "input": "AIMS The risk to patients and healthcare workers of resuming elective orthopaedic surgery following the peak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been difficult to quantify. This has prompted governing bodies to adopt a cautious approach that may be impractical and financially unsustainable. The lack of evidence has made it impossible for surgeons to give patients an informed perspective of the consequences of elective surgery in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to determine, for the UK population, the probability of a patient being admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection and their resulting risk of death; taking into consideration the current disease prevalence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and preassessment pathway. METHODS The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative test was calculated using a lower-end RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, and the UK disease prevalence of 0.24% reported in May 2020. Subsequently, a case fatality rate of 20.5% was applied as a worst-case scenario. RESULTS The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative preoperative test was 0.07% (around 1 in 1,400). The risk of a patient with an undetected infection being admitted for surgery and subsequently dying from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated at approximately 1 in 7,000. However, if an estimate of the current global infection fatality rate (1.04%) is applied, the risk of death would be around 1 in 140,000, at most. This calculation does not take into account the risk of nosocomial infection. Conversely, it does not factor in that patients will also be clinically assessed and asked to self-isolate prior to surgery. CONCLUSION Our estimation suggests that the risk of patients being inadvertently admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection for elective orthopaedic surgery is relatively low. Accordingly, the risk of death following elective orthopaedic surgery is low, even when applying the worst-case fatality rate. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2020;102-B(9):1-5.",

Although conventional vaccines are available, their protective efficacy is type or strain specific, and their production is time-consuming. For the control of an influenza pandemic in particular, agents that are immediately effective against a wide range of virus variants should be developed. Although pretreatment of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands have already been reported to be effective in the defense against subsequent IAV infection, the efficacy was limited to specific subtypes, and safety concerns were also raised. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of an attenuated bacterial outer membrane vesicle -harboring modified lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (fmOMV) against IAV infection and the underlying mechanisms. Administration of fmOMV conferred significant protection against a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1, PR8, H5N2, and highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses; this broad antiviral activity was dependent on macrophages but independent of neutrophils. fmOMV induced recruitment and activation of macrophages and elicited type I IFNs. Intriguingly, fmOMV showed a more significant protective effect than other TLR ligands tested in previous reports, without exhibiting any adverse effect. These results show the potential of fmOMV as a prophylactic agent for the defense against influenza virus infection.",

First of all, given the immunosuppressive effect of many therapies that are normally administered to patients with hematological diseases, with a consequent increased risk of contracting a more severe viral infection, it has been necessary to reconsider in each individual patient the urgency and priority of the treatments foreseen by the normal standards of care. In particular, as regards allogeneic (and to a lesser extent autologous) hematopoietic cell transplantation and CAR T-cell therapy, specific recommendations have been issued by the transplant community on the criteria to be used to decide whether or not to postpone these procedures and on the clinical management of recipients and donors exposed to COVID-19. As to cytotoxic chemotherapy and other antineoplastic therapies, criteria have been proposed to decide, in the various clinical situations, which treatments were not deferrable and which instead could be postponed or replaced by less aggressive therapies. In the outpatient clinics, various organizational solutions for telemedicine have been adopted, resorting to telephone interviews and/or Information Technology, with the aim of reducing the influx of patients while maintaining an adequate control of their clinical condition. The collection of blood by the transfusion centers has been the subject of organizational measures, in order to avoid the transmission of COVID 19 while maintaining a sufficient blood collection for clinical needs. Finally, some hematologic laboratory alterations have been identified, such as thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and coagulation abnormalities, useful for the prognostic evaluation of infected patients.",

However, the detection rate of AF is low after ischemic stroke. Developing a prediction model for newly diagnosed AF after ischemic stroke will help to assess the subclinical AF.We identified 98,103 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and 261,893 patients without DM, who were not AF history and admitted for newly ischemic stroke from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The prediction model for 3-year incidence of AF after ischemic stroke was derived from multivariate logistic regression and also the accuracy rate of the prediction model was compared with CHA2DS2-VASC and CHADS2 scores as a reference.Four thousand nine hundred seventy six patients in the DM cohort and 16,127 patients in the non-DM cohort developed AF during 3 years of follow-up. The variables in the point-based prediction model for non-DM patients (range: -3-28), included age, heart failure, coronary artery disease, gout, obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, female, and statin use, while those for DM patients (range: -2-30) included age, heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, obstructive pulmonary disease, and statin use. Compared to the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scoring systems, this scoring system was better at predicting 3-year risk of AF after ischemic stroke in both cohorts.This model might be useful in evaluating the benefit of insertable cardiac monitor implantation and anticoagulation agents in individual patients after ischemic stroke.",

T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting studies suggested that the sequences of each RNA species were totally included within the next large RNa species. The oligonucleotides of each RNA species were mapped on the 60S RNA genome of the virus. Each RNA species contained the oligonucleotides starting from the 3' end of the genome and extending continuously for various lengths in the 3' leads to 5' direction. All of the viral RNA species contained a polyadenylate stretch of 100 to 130 nucleotides and probably identical sequences immediately next to the polyadenylate. These data suggested that the virus-specific RNAs are mRNA's and have a stairlike structure similar to that of infectious bronchitis virus, an avian coronavirus. A proposal is presented, based on the mRNA structure, for the designation of the genes on the MHV genome.

Materials and Methods: The study includes 386 consecutive patients recruited from 10 March to 30 June 2020 among those being treated at the Institute of Psychopathology in Rome (Italy) with an age &#8805;18 years and meeting DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (35.2%), bipolar I (BD-I) (21.5%) or II (BD-II) (28.8%) disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (7.5%), panic disorder (PD) (7.0%) or social anxiety (SA). A total of 34.2% had lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders and 15.3% had alcohol/drug abuse disorders. Using a semi-structured interview, we investigated if the impact of COVID-19 stress for patients has been similar, higher or lower than that of their family and friends and, for patients with relapse/symptoms worsening, if there was a relationship between the clinical condition worsening and the pandemic stress. Results: Compared with that experienced by their family members and friends, the psychological impact of pandemic stress was similar in 52.1% of the sample, better in 37.1% and worse in 10.8%. In 21 patients (5.4%), the stress triggered a recurrence or worsened the symptoms. Patients with OCD had a higher rate of worsening due to pandemic stress compared to patients with MDD (p = 0.033), although, overall, the &#967;2 test was not significant among primary diagnoses (&#967;2 = 8.368; p = 0.057). Conclusions: The psychological and psychopathological consequences of COVID-19 stress in our outpatients were very modest. The continuity of care offered during the lockdown could explain the results.",

Biological research can provide clues for a correct approach to clinical practice, assuming that it would lead to the conceptualization of a pathogenetic paradigm able to account for epidemiologic and clinical findings.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Population-based genomic screening has the predicted ability to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with medically actionable conditions. However, much research is needed to develop standards for genomic screening and to understand the perspectives of people offered this new testing modality. This is particularly true for non-European ancestry populations who are vastly underrepresented in genomic medicine research. Therefore, we implemented a pilot genomic screening program in the BioMe Biobank in New York City, where the majority of participants are of non-European ancestry. METHODS: We initiated genomic screening for well-established genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), Lynch syndrome (LS), and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). We evaluated and included an additional gene (TTR) associated with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR), which has a common founder variant in African ancestry populations. We evaluated the characteristics of 74 participants who received results associated with these conditions. We also assessed the preferences of 7461 newly enrolled BioMe participants to receive genomic results. RESULTS: In the pilot genomic screening program, 74 consented participants received results related to HBOC (N = 26), LS (N = 6), FH (N = 8), and hATTR (N = 34). Thirty-three of 34 (97.1%) participants who received a result related to hATTR were self-reported African American/African (AA) or Hispanic/Latinx (HL), compared to 14 of 40 (35.0%) participants who received a result related to HBOC, LS, or FH. Among the 7461 participants enrolled after the BioMe protocol modification to allow the return of genomic results, 93.4% indicated that they would want to receive results. Younger participants, women, and HL participants were more likely to opt to receive results. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of TTR to a pilot genomic screening program meant that we returned results to a higher proportion of AA and HL participants, in comparison with genes traditionally included in genomic screening programs in the USA. We found that the majority of participants in a multi-ethnic biobank are interested in receiving genomic results for medically actionable conditions. These findings increase knowledge about the perspectives of diverse research participants on receiving genomic results and inform the broader implementation of genomic medicine in underrepresented patient populations.

We first determine the existence of a unique global positive solution and a positively invariant set for the stochastic system. Sufficient conditions for extinction and persistence in the mean of the disease are then achieved by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Based on the analysis, we conclude that noise intensity and the validity period of vaccination greatly influence the transmission dynamics of the system.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of social media data sources for a wide range of public health goals, including disease surveillance, mental health trends, and health perceptions and sentiment. Most such research has focused on English-language social media for the task of disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the value of Chinese social media for monitoring air quality trends and related public perceptions and response. The goal was to determine if this data is suitable for learning actionable information about pollution levels and public response. METHODS: We mined a collection of 93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China\u2019s largest microblogging service. We experimented with different filters to identify messages relevant to air quality, based on keyword matching and topic modeling. We evaluated the reliability of the data filters by comparing message volume per city to air particle pollution rates obtained from the Chinese government for 74 cities. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study of the content of pollution-related messages by coding a sample of 170 messages for relevance to air quality, and whether the message included details such as a reactive behavior or a health concern. RESULTS: The volume of pollution-related messages is highly correlated with particle pollution levels, with Pearson correlation values up to .718 (n=74, P<.001). Our qualitative results found that 67.1% (114/170) of messages were relevant to air quality and of those, 78.9% (90/114) were a firsthand report. Of firsthand reports, 28% (32/90) indicated a reactive behavior and 19% (17/90) expressed a health concern. Additionally, 3 messages of 170 requested that action be taken to improve quality. CONCLUSIONS: We have found quantitatively that message volume in Sina Weibo is indicative of true particle pollution levels, and we have found qualitatively that messages contain rich details including perceptions, behaviors, and self-reported health effects. Social media data can augment existing air pollution surveillance data, especially perception and health-related data that traditionally requires expensive surveys or interviews.",

We studied the dispersion of exhaled air through a simple oxygen mask applied to a human patient simulator (HPS) during the delivery of different oxygen flow in a room free of air currents. METHODS: The HPS represented a 70-kg adult male individual in a semi-sitting position on a hospital bed inclined at 45\u00b0. A simple oxygen mask was fitted to the HPS in the normal fashion. The head, neck, and internal airways of the HPS were configured to allow realistic airflow modeling in the airways and around the face. The HPS was programmed to breathe at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 L. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light-sheet, and images were captured by high-resolution video. Smoke concentration in the exhaled plume was estimated from the total light intensity scattered by smoke particles. FINDINGS: A jet plume of air leaked through the side vents of the simple oxygen mask to lateral distances of 0.2, 0.22, 0.3, and 0.4 m from the sagittal plane during the delivery of oxygen at 4, 6, 8, and 10 L/min, respectively. Coughing could extend the dispersion distance beyond 0.4 m. CONCLUSION: Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs generally within 0.4 m from patients receiving supplemental oxygen via a simple mask.

She used to report me that she always feared in the evening I mean she think that now evening starts and her bed will shake in the night, she felt someone presence near to her door and table. When she go on bed got sleep than she think that some is shaking her bed she jumped on the bed and her sleep broken. She is not able to take sleep properly because of this fear problem and used to take medicine for the sleep.            I listen to her very patiently but I got perturbed when I saw her in pain. I am not able to her except giving her some assurance. I discussed with yesterday night whether she got similar fear when she stays with me. She said no. She only got those dreams when she is alone. I asked her to go and meet with people in the hostel. She said she did the same. When she speak to me over phone nothing comes in her mind but as soon as she got alone she starts thinking in same direction.            I am writing to you by keeping in my mind that you can help me in some way. Please advise me how to handle the situation so that I can see her happy. I cannot see her in pain.

However, conventional animal models severely inhibit collateral blood flow and mimic the malignant infarction profile not suitable for treatment. The aim of this study was to provide a clinically relevant profile of the emergence and course of ischemic injury in cases suitable for acute intervention, and was achieved by employing a M2 occlusion model (M2CAO) that more accurately simulates middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in humans. Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to Short (90 min), Intermediate (180 min) or Extended (600 min) transient M2CAO and examined longitudinally with interleaved diffusion-, T2- and arterial spin labeling perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before and after reperfusion. We identified a rapid emergence of cytotoxic edema within tissue regions undergoing infarction, progressing in several distinct phases in the form of subsequent moderation and then reversal at 230 min (p < 0.0001). We identified also the early emergence of vasogenic edema, which increased consistently before and after reperfusion (p < 0.0001). The perfusion of the penumbra correlated more strongly to the perfusion of adjacent tissue regions than did the perfusion of regions undergoing infarction (p = 0.0088). This was interpreted as an effect of preserved collateral blood flow during M2CAO. Accordingly, we observed only limited recruitment of penumbra regions to the infarction core. However, a gradual increase in infarction size was still occurring as late as 10 hours after M2CAO. Our results indicate that patients suffering MCA branch occlusion stand to benefit from interventional therapy for an extended time period after the emergence of ischemic injury.",

SETTING Social media platform Twitter.com. DESIGN Retrospective review. METHODS Retrospective analysis of Twitter use during the ASCRS Virtual Meeting in May 2020. All tweets and associated metadata pertaining to the conference were compiled starting from when the virtual meeting was announced (April 8, 2020) to 2 weeks post-conference (May 31, 2020). Two coders independently coded all tweets and excluded tweets if they were irrelevant or no longer available. RESULTS A total of 501 tweets were reviewed. 48.5% of tweets came from private accounts, 23.1% from academic institutions, 14.4% from ASCRS accounts, 12.4% from industry and 1.6% from professional organizations. 29.1% of the tweets were shared before the conference (n=146), 60.5% during (n=303), and 10.4% after the conference (n=52). 62.9% (n=315) of tweets promoted conference events, 27.3% (n=137) were about research studies, 27.1% (n=136) were social posts, 23.0% (n=115) were from industry sponsors, 4.4% (n=22) of tweets were self-promotion, and 1.0% (n=5) were not categorized. Twitter impressions on the ASCRS account increased by 79% in 2020 compared to the 2019 annual meeting. CONCLUSIONS To the author's knowledge, this first study to describe how Twitter users engaged with a virtual ophthalmology meeting through social media during the coronavirus pandemic. Findings from this study offers insight on how the ophthalmology community can use social media during conferences and highlights opportunities for networking through social media for both virtual and in-person conferences in the future.",

        "input": "Background: Finding the ideal candidate for a residency/fellowship program has always been difficult. Finding the \u201cperfect\u201d match has always been the ultimate goal. However, many factors affect obtaining that \u201cperfect\u201d match. In the past, we would have each attending physician review around 20 to 50 Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications and rank them into three categories: high, middle, or low. Depending on their ranking, the applicant would be invited for an interview. After the interview, the applicants\u2019 files (ERAS and interview) would be reviewed and ranked by the faculty as a group. This was time-consuming and fraught with too much subjectivity and minimal objectivity. We, therefore, sought to find a way to assess and rank applicants in a more objective and less time-consuming manner. By creating a customizable scoring tool, we were able to screen applicants to our pulmonary/critical care fellowship program in an efficient and a more objective manner. Objectives: A customizable scoring tool was developed weighting components in the ERAS and interview process, allowing residency/fellowship programs to create a final rank list consistent with the programs\u2019 desired applicants. Methods: Two hundred and sixty pulmonary/critical care fellowship applications were reviewed from 2013 to 2018. In 2018, we used our new scoring rubric to create a rank list and rescore previous applicants. The traditional and new lists were compared to the final rank list submitted to the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) for 2018. We wanted to ascertain which scoring method correlated best with the final rank list submitted to the NRMP. We obtained feedback from eight faculty members who had reviewed applicants with both scoring tools. Results: The novel customizable scoring tool positively correlated with the final rank list submitted to the NRMP (r= 0.86). The novel tool showed a better correlation to the final rank list than the traditional method. Faculties (6/6, 100%) responded positively to the new tool. Conclusions: Our new customizable tool has allowed us to create a final rank list that is efficient and more focused on our faculty\u2019s desired applicants. We hope to assess and compare the quality of applicants matched through this scoring system and the traditional method by using faculty evaluations, milestones, and test scores.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections are often unreported, which means that confirmed case counts may not accurately reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. METHODS: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever &#8805; 37.5 \u00b0C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the baseline case fatality ratio (CFR), which was adjusted for delays and under-ascertainment, then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. RESULTS: Based on reported cases and deaths, we estimated that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.4% (Bangladesh) to 100% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6 July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 18 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. As of 7 June, our seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (many countries) to 13% (95% CrI 5.6-24%) (Belgium). CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.",

The objective of this paper was to conduct a knowledge synthesis of the published and grey literatures to develop a theoretical framework with the key features of EIP institutionalization. METHODS: We applied a critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) that allowed for a systematic, yet iterative and dynamic analysis of heterogeneous bodies of literature to develop an explanatory framework for EIP institutionalization. We used a \u201ccompass\u201d question to create a detailed search strategy and conducted electronic searches to identify papers based on their potential relevance to EIP institutionalization. Papers were screened and extracted independently and in duplicate. A constant comparative method was applied to develop a framework on EIP institutionalization. The CIS was triangulated with the findings of stakeholder dialogues that involved civil servants, policy-makers and researchers. RESULTS: We identified 3001 references, of which 88 papers met our eligibility criteria. This CIS resulted in a definition of EIP institutionalization as the \u201cprocess and outcome of (re-)creating, maintaining and reinforcing norms, regulations, and standard practices that, based on collective meaning and values, actions as well as endowment of resources, allow evidence to become\u2014over time\u2014a legitimate and taken-for-granted part of health policy-making\u201d. The resulting theoretical framework comprised six key domains of EIP institutionalization that capture both structure and agency: (1) governance; (2) standards and routinized processes; (3) partnership, collective action and support; (4) leadership and commitment; (5) resources; and (6) culture. Furthermore, EIP institutionalization is being achieved through five overlapping stages: (i) precipitating events; (ii) de-institutionalization; (iii) semi-institutionalization (comprising theorization and diffusion); (iv) (re)-institutionalization; and (v) renewed de-institutionalization processes. CONCLUSIONS: This CIS advances the theoretical and conceptual discussions on EIP institutionalization, and provides new insights into an evidence-informed framework for initiating, strengthening and/or assessing efforts to institutionalize EIP.

However, abstinence from all non-prescribed substance use continues to be prioritized as the only desired goal in many outpatient, primary care\u2013based treatment programs. This presents a barrier to engagement for patients who continue to use substances and who may be at high risk for complications of ongoing substance use such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), superficial and deep tissue infections, and overdose. Harm reduction aims to reduce the negative consequences of substance use and offers an alternative to abstinence as a singular goal. Incorporating harm reduction principles into primary care treatment settings can support programs in engaging patients with ongoing substance use and facilitate the delivery of evidence-based screening and prevention services. The objective of this narrative review is to describe strategies for the integration of evidence-based harm reduction principles and interventions into outpatient, primary care\u2013based OUD treatment settings. We will offer specific tools for providers and programs including strategies to support safer injection practices, assess the risks and benefits of continuing medications for opioid use disorder in the setting of ongoing substance use, promote a non-stigmatizing program culture, and address the needs of special populations with ongoing substance use including adolescents, parents, and families.

The sociotechnical course covered modern energy concepts, with an emphasis on renewable energies and sustainability, and it exposed the students to other ways of being, knowing, and doing that deviated from the dominant masculine Western White colonial discourse. Following the course completion, we interviewed five students by using a semistructured protocol to explore how they perceived of and communicated about engineers and engineering. We sought to identify the takeaways from their course exposure to sustainability and the sociotechnical paradigm, which were central to the course. The findings suggest that the students were beginning to form sociotechnical descriptions, and that they were still developing their understanding and perceptions of engineers and engineering. Moreover, we observed that they were still wrestling with how best to integrate sustainability into those perceptions. There was an a-la-carte feel to the students\u2019 conceptualizations of sustainability as it related to engineering, as in, \u201cyou can \u2018do\u2019 sustainability with engineering, but do not have to\u201d.

In study 1, freshmen from several Chinese universities (N = 1,224) were recruited to complete a battery of questionnaire, including assessments about interpersonal stress, grit, and psychological security. The moderating effect analysis showed that grit moderated the relationship between interpersonal stress and psychological security.

In study 2, college freshmen from another university apart from above ones (N = 604) were recruited, and we verified the results of study 1 and further explored the mediating role of grit in the relationship between interpersonal stress and security. The moderating effect analysis of study 2 also verified that of study 1. The mediating effect analysis showed that interpersonal stress not only negatively predicted psychological security, but also affected psychological security through the mediation of grit.

One of the government's efforts to recover everything back is to stop the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing. Artists' efforts to support recovery in the pandemic era are by using virtual galleries. A virtual gallery is a place to exhibit art but online. The case studies in this study will be taken from Indonesian artists in Bandung, especially those who have used virtual galleries. This study aims to measure the level of acceptance of virtual galleries by Indonesian artists in Bandung by using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) method. Five components measured by TAM include: PEU (Perceived Ease of Use), PU (Perceived Usefulness), ATU (Attitude Toward Using), BIU (Behavioral Intention to Use), and AU (Actual Use). Analysis method is using quantitative descriptive and data collection technique used a survey method approach with purposive sampling technique, and the respondents were users of the virtual gallery application in the city of Bandung with 25 respondents. The validity test will use product-moment correlation, and the reliability test will use Cronbach Alpha. Then for the analysis will use simple linear regression through the SPSS application. This study has six initial hypotheses, namely H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6, where the six hypotheses have a positive and significant effect, meaning virtual gallery is accepted among artists. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

        "input": " Congenital diaphragmatic hernia congenital diaphragmatic defect Description Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth. In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare. Frequency Congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1 in 2,500 newborns. Causes Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes. About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations. More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified. Inheritance Pattern Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rarely inherited. In almost all cases, there is only one affected individual in a family. When congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition.

We illustrate our arguments through our own experience in creating a validated infographic for patients, now disseminated through social media and other outlets across the world in nearly 20 translations. Visual communication offers a creative and practical medium to bridge critical health literacy gaps, empower diverse patient communities through evidence-based information and facilitate public health advocacy during this pandemic and the 'new normal' that lies ahead.",

However, data on current patients', caregivers' and clinicians' satisfaction and limitations of treatments and haemophilia management are limited. AIM Assessing the management satisfaction and unmet needs from the perspective of Italian patients with haemophilia (PWH) without inhibitors (or caregivers if children) and of specialist physicians. METHODS Surveys (for patients\u226518 years, caregivers of children and haemophilia specialists) were developed by a multidisciplinary working group and conducted from November 2019 to June 2020. RESULTS Among 275 participants, 120 (43.6%) were PWH without inhibitors, 79 (28.7%) caregivers and 37 (13.4%) clinicians. Patients and caregivers perceived a higher control of the disease compared to clinicians. However, more than 40% of patients and caregivers reported to feel significantly conditioned by the risk of bleeding during their daily life. PWH reported a 6-month mean/median (range) of bleeds 2.3/.0 (0-24) and caregivers 1.3/.0 (0-16) in children. The treatment burden (frequency of administration) was not satisfactory for more than half adults and caregivers of children treated with prophylaxis. A good access to treatment, haemophilia centres and medical service was reported, with issues associated to the multidisciplinary approach and treatment at emergency department. CONCLUSIONS This large national study provides an updated overview of haemophilia care in Italy from different points of views, highlighting positive aspects and unmet needs. This information can guide future interventions to improve haemophilia management and the assessment of impact of new treatment options.",

However, some effective measures can prevent medical staff from becoming infected. This article introduces those measures and thus provides a reference for other hospitals. OBJECTIVE: In order to reduce the risk of occupational exposure and of the infection of medical staff, this article analyzed the factors, causes and experience of medical personnel on their occupational exposure to COVID-19. Some effective and targeted intervention measures can be implemented in order to avoid the occupational exposure of medical staff to COVID-19. EVIDENCE REVIEW: In this single-center case series involving 196 medical personnel, occupational exposure to COVID-19 was present. Nursing staff accounted for 67.35% of those cases. The relationships with an exposure source were found to be as follows: doctors and patients (87.24%), colleagues (10.20%), and roommates (2.55%). Occupational exposure was found to be present in the clinical department, radiology department, central sterile supply department, as well as in the outpatient clinics and operating rooms. The non-surgical departments accounted for 72.96% and direct contact accounted for 84.69% while failure to wear surgical masks (84.18%) and operating on the patient without wearing goggles/face shield (8.16%) were the main causes of occupational exposure. The occurrence of occupational exposure to COVID-19 declined to 0.19% after an extensive and comprehensive intervention program. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Some effective measures such as hand hygiene, wearing surgical masks in and around the hospital, reasonable use of goggles/face screens, raising awareness of protective measures, minimizing the number of elective operations, strengthening training as well as many other control measures were instrumental in reducing occupational exposure. For any medical institution there is room for improvement in terms of personal protection to reduce occupational exposure.",

        "input": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed daunting challenges for the conduction of clinical research. Adopting new technologies such as remote electronic consent (e-Consent) can help overcome them. However, guidelines for e-Consent implementation in ongoing clinical trials are currently lacking. The NeuroSAFE PROOF trial is a randomised clinical trial evaluating the role of frozen section analysis during RARP for prostate cancer. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, recruitment was halted, and a remote e-Consent solution was designed. The aim of this paper is to describe the process of implementation, impact on recruitment rate and patients\u2019 experience using e-Consent. Methods: : A substantial amendment of the protocol granted the creation of a remote e-Consent framework based on the REDCap environment, following the structure and content of the already approved paper consent form. A new pathway was developed which offered continuous support to patients through remote consultations. The whole process was judged to be compliant with regulatory requirements before implementation. Results: : Before the first recruitment suspension, NeuroSAFE PROOF was recruiting an average of 9 patients per month. After e-Consent implementation, 63 new patients (4/month) have been enrolled despite a second lockdown, none of whom would have been recruited using the old methods given restrictions on face-to-face consultations. Patients have given positive feedback on the use of the platform. Limited troubleshooting has been required after implementation. Conclusion: Remote e-Consent based recruitment was critical for the continuation of the NeuroSAFE PROOF trial during the COVID-19 pandemic. The described pathway complies with ethical and regulatory guidelines for informed consent, while minimizing face-to-face interactions that increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This guide will help researchers integrate e-Consent to ongoing or planned clinical trials while uncertainty about the course of the pandemic continues.

It is supported by the presence of the horseshoe bat suspected to be the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 and by the scarcity of pork, due to African swine fever, diverting consumers to exotic animals of breeding sold in the markets. During this pandemic, several animal species were affected by SARS-CoV-2. Sporadic cases were first reported in pets (dogs and cats) infected by their owners, then in large feline species and apes infected in zoos by their nurses. The most significant human-to-animal transmission has occurred in mink farms, especially in the Netherlands and Denmark, requiring the euthanasia of several million animals, with mink in turn having contaminated men and stray or nomadic cats. The study of natural or experimental transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 has made it possible to identify the most receptive animal species: American minks and raccoon dogs, and to a lesser extent stray or nomadic cats, which could become an animal reservoir due to their sensitivity to this virus and their extending prolificacy. The European Commission decided on May 17, 2021 to strengthen the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in minks and other mustelids, as well as in raccoon dogs, highlighting stressing that the epidemiological assessment of the risk presented by the he appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in these susceptible species was a public health priority.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The role of educational settings in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission remains controversial. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence, and seroconversion rates in secondary schools during the 2020/21 academic year, which included the emergence of the more transmissible alpha and delta variants, in England. METHODS: The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) initiated prospective surveillance in 18 urban English secondary schools. Participants had nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and blood sampling for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike protein antibodies at the start (Round 1: September-October 2020) and end (Round 2: December 2020) of the autumn term, when schools reopened after national lockdown was imposed in January 2021 (Round 3: March-April 2021), and end of the academic year (Round 4: May-July 2021). FINDINGS: We enrolled 2314 participants (1277 students, 1037 staff; one participant had missing data for PCR testing). In-school testing identified 31 PCR-positive participants (20 students, 11 staff). Another 247 confirmed cases (112 students, 135 staff) were identified after linkage with national surveillance data, giving an overall positivity rate of 12.0% (278/2313; staff: 14.1%, 146/1037 vs students: 10.3%, 132/1276; p = 0.006). Trends were similar to national infection data. Nucleoprotein-antibody seroprevalence increased for students and staff between Rounds 1 and 3 but were similar between Rounds 3 and 4, when the delta variant was the dominant circulating strain. Overall, Nucleoprotein-antibody seroconversion was 18.4% (137/744) in staff and 18.8% (146/778) in students, while Spike-antibody seroconversion was higher in staff (72.8%, 525/721) than students (21.3%, 163/764) because of vaccination. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in secondary schools remained low when community infection rates were low, even as the delta variant was emerging in England. FUNDING: This study was funded by the UK Department of Health and Social Care.",

Given your description of a stiff and dull aching neck, I would like to explore some possible causes. It's possible that inflammation in the facet joints or nerve pinch could be contributing to your discomfort. Additionally, muscle weakness may also be playing a role. While massage can sometimes provide relief, it's important to note that it can also temporarily weaken muscles, leading to abnormal symptoms. In light of this, I would advise against further massages for now.\n\nTo better understand the underlying pathology and develop an effective treatment plan, I recommend considering X-ray or MRI imaging of your cervical spine, as well as a clinical examination. A physical therapist may be able to help reduce your pain and strengthen the muscles involved, which could ultimately help alleviate these dull aches.\n\nRegarding the double vision you experienced after the massage, I would suggest seeking further advice and examination from a neurologist to rule out any underlying neurological issues. While it's possible that this was an isolated incident related to the massage, it's always better to be safe than sorry.\n\nIn my clinical practice, I often recommend avoiding massages for patients with similar concerns and instead opt for physical therapy as a more effective approach. I hope this helps, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Best regards, Jay.\"",

        "input": "BACKGROUND The first reported case of the novel coronavirus (COVID 19) in Nigeria was on the 27th of February 2020. Since then, the country has witnessed a steady increase in the number of patients confirmed with the disease. As of April 27th 2021, a total of 164,756 confirmed COVID-19 cases were notified making it the fifth-highest number of cases in the African region. This study aims to determine the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in Nigeria, identify clusters and determine factors associated with COVID-19. METHODS The study used secondary data of COVID-19 cases notified in each of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory between 27th February and 9th June, 2020. The Global and Local Moran'sItest were used to identify significant spatial clusters. The negative binomial regression model was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 and p d\" 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS The Local Moran I identified Lagos State as the significant cluster for COVID-19 in Nigeria at p<0.05. Higher GDP per capita and lower literacy rates were significantly associated with COVID-19 cases reported by the states while population density, BCG coverage and average temperature were not significantly associated. CONCLUSION The study identified Lagos State as the hotspot for the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The states with lower literacy rate and higher GDP per capita reported a higher number of COVID-19 cases. Proactive measures are needed to control of the infection in Lagos state while improving the literacy about the disease transmission and control measures.",

This study examined the incidence of different types of WPV in a public hospital in Israel during the pandemic and analyzes the factors associated with its occurrence. A cross-sectional study was performed via an online questionnaire with 486 workers at a government hospital in Israel. Data were collected about sociodemographic and occupational characteristics, exposure to different forms of WPV over the preceding six months, and the responsibility and reasons for WPV from the workers\u2019 perspective. Approximately 71% of respondents were exposed to WPV and 64% perceived that WPV escalated during the pandemic. The prevalence of verbal/psychological and physical WPV were 69 and 11%, respectively. The main reason for WPV was frustration over long wait times (70%). The escalation during the pandemic can be attributed to patients\u2019 or relatives\u2019 anxiety and mental states following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (72%), an increase in waiting time since the pandemic began (54%), lack of hospital resources to care for everyone (45%), and the inability to visit critically ill relatives with COVID-19 (44%). Increased exposure to WPV was attributed to lower seniority, working in emergency or internal departments, and being a nurse or a doctor. The findings raise an urgent need to develop strategies to reduce WPV in hospitals at all levels: national, organizational, and individual. Further research could focus on the effectiveness of innovative strategies and interventions to prevent violence against healthcare workers.",

Overall, a relative decelaration of time passage was generally associated with negative affect and social isolation; a relative acceleration was associated with an increase in routine in daily life. There is some variability in results depending on the country of study and COVID-19 restrictions introduced, participants\u2019 demographics, and questionnaire items applied. Here we present a study conducted in May 2021 in Germany including n = 500 participants to assess time perception, emotional reactions, and attitudes towards the countermeasures. The passage of time judgments (POTJ) for the preceding 12 months during the pandemic were compared to data addressing the same question posed in previous studies conducted before the outbreak of COVID-19. The previous year was rated as having passed relatively slower during the pandemic compared to the ratings from before the pandemic. The duration judgments (DJ) of the 14 months since the start of the pandemic showed a bimodal distribution with both relatively shorter and relatively longer DJs. Higher levels of several negative emotions, as well as less social satisfaction, were associated with prolonged DJs and partially slower POTJs. Fear for health was not linked with the subjective experience of time, but exploratory analyses suggested that higher levels of fear were linked to more positive evaluations and approval of the governmental countermeasures. Those who reported higher levels of negative, agitated-aggressive emotions showed lower levels of consent with these measures.",

METHOD: The nursing students and instructors worked collaboratively with the clinical team to call patients using an algorithm that incorporates screeners for depression, anxiety, and chronic disease distress. RESULTS: Reports during daily debriefings and feedback obtained from evaluations were summarized by faculty and used to improve the activity. These reports indicated the experience was beneficial to students and clinic staff. CONCLUSION: Providers were able to follow up on vulnerable patients more quickly, students were able to practice essential nursing skills during a time when safety concerns limited direct patient interaction, and patients continued to feel connected to health care providers during a global pandemic.

        "input": "The uptake of the current concept of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by the public, physicians and health authorities is low. Physicians still mix up CKD with chronic kidney insufficiency or failure. In a recent manuscript, only 23% of participants in a cohort of persons with CKD had been diagnosed by their physicians as having CKD while 29% has a diagnosis of cancer and 82% had a diagnosis of hypertension. For the wider public and health authorities, CKD evokes kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In Spain, the prevalence of KRT is 0.13%. A prevalent view is that for those in whom kidneys fail, the problem is \u201csolved\u201d by dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, the main burden of CKD is accelerated aging and all-cause and cardiovascular premature death. CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for lethal COVID-19 and the factor that most increases the risk of death in COVID-19, after old age. Moreover, men and women undergoing KRT still have an annual mortality which is 10\u2013100-fold higher than similar age peers, and life expectancy is shortened by around 40 years for young persons on dialysis and by 15 years for young persons with a functioning kidney graft. CKD is expected to become the fifth global cause of death by 2040 and the second cause of death in Spain before the end of the century, a time when 1 in 4 Spaniards will have CKD. However, by 2022, CKD will become the only top-15 global predicted cause of death that is not supported by a dedicated well-funded CIBER network research structure in Spain. Leading Spanish kidney researchers grouped in the kidney collaborative research network REDINREN have now applied for the RICORS call of collaborative research in Spain with the support of the Spanish Society of Nephrology, ALCER and ONT: RICORS2040 aims to prevent the dire predictions for the global 2040 burden of CKD from becoming true.

This study proposed a novel and easy-to-calculate prediction score using clinical and point of care laboratory findings in patients with abdominal trauma (AT). METHODS: Patients with AT admitted to a trauma center in Qatar between 2014 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The FASILA score was proposed and calculated using focused assessment with sonography in trauma (0 = negative, 1 = positive), Shock Index (SI) (0 = 0.50\u20130.69, 1 = 0.70\u20130.79, 2 = 0.80\u20130.89, and 3 \u2265 0.90), and initial serum lactate (0 \u2264 2.0, 1 = 2.0\u20134.0, and 2 \u2265 4.0 mmol/l). Outcome variables included mortality, laparotomy, and massive blood transfusion (MT). FASILA was compared to other prediction scores using receiver operating characteristics and areas under the curves. Bootstrap procedure was employed for internal validation. RESULTS: In 1199 patients with a mean age of 31 \u00b1 13.5 years, MT, MT protocol (MTP) activation, exploratory laparotomy (ExLap), and hospital mortality were related linearly with the FASILA score, Injury Severity Score, and total length of hospital stay. Initial hemoglobin, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), and Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS) were inversely proportional. FASILA scores correlated significantly with the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) (r = 0.65), Revised Assessment of Bleeding and Transfusion (RABT) (r = 0.63), SI (r = 0.72), RTS (r = \u2212 0.34), and Glasgow Coma Scale (r = \u2212 0.32) and outperformed other predictive systems (RABT, ABC, and SI) in predicting MT, MTP, ExLap, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The novel FASILA score performs well in patients with abdominal trauma and offers advantages over other scores.

To alleviate your discomfort, I recommend avoiding stress and tension, staying relaxed and calm. Also, try to avoid hot and spicy foods, large meals, and opt for frequent small meals instead. Consider starting proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic medications as well. With these steps, you should see significant improvement. I hope this helps address your concerns. Wishing you good health and a speedy recovery. Thank you again for reaching out!",

During COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian National Health System has been overwhelmed by the continue load of life-threatening patients that needed medical assistance. Plastic surgery practice enormously scaled back during this period and this fact greatly affected elective procedures waiting lists. The aim of our study is to analyze how the lockdown and its related sanitary policies affected post-bariatric patients' behaviors towards the delay of their procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS A 7-item questionnaire was administered to all patients. Change in the desire to be subjected to body contouring procedures was recorded. Smoking status, level of training during quarantine and psychological co-morbidities were also evaluated. RESULTS 124 patients completed the questionnaire. Data analysis showed that none of them encountered a decrease of the desire to be subjected to post-bariatric plastic surgery procedures. CONCLUSIONS The present study showed that all the patients in the waiting list did not modify their interest in being subjected to post-bariatric surgery procedures, even though the waiting time increased.",

        "input": "Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the L-2 subline of mouse fibroblasts results in acute infection characterized by extensive cell fusion. In contrast, infection of the LM-K subline leads to virus persistence with reduced cell fusion. We undertook studies designed to elucidate the role of host cell membrane lipid composition and the cytoskeleton in modulating the fusion process and the resultant effect(s) on virus persistence. MHV-induced cell fusion proceeded normally in cells treated with cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs, cytochalasin B and colchicine. Modification of cell membrane fatty acid composition by supplementation of LM-K cells with arachidonic (C-20:4) or palmitic (C-16:0) acids had little effect on the extent of MHV-induced cell fusion or on virus replication. However, supplementation of both cell types with cholesterol (resulting in increased membrane cholesterol/fatty acid ratio) resulted in marked enhancement of virus-mediated cell fusion. The increase in cell membrane cholesterol did not enhance internalization of MHV suggesting that cholesterol primarily modulates a later event. This suggestion was confirmed by demonstrating cholesterol-enhancement of fusion in a contact fusion assay. Cholesterol-supplemented L-2 cells were less productive for virus replication than unsupplemented cells, in agreement with our previous observations that MHV replication is compromised by extensive cytopathic effect. Although cholesterol-supplemented LM-K cells showed increased susceptibility to MHV-mediated cell fusion, the extent of such susceptibility did not approach that observed in L-2 cells. Also, the property of LM-K cells to support MHV persistence was not abolished by cholesterol supplementation. Thus membrane fusion resistance and MHV persistence are modulated but not alleviated by cell membrane cholesterol content.",

Don t said I could be starting menopause. Then I started having pain on both right and left sides and doctor put me on a regiment of antibiotic s to get the jump on any possible infections early and cut back to clear liquids until the problem passes. ( my suggestion) cause I still do not have insurance. I get extremely bloated during these times. I have noticed in the last six months that I get the same pain on the lower left side each month around the same time. (pain on the right is gone). I asked for an pelvic ultrasound to see if my ovaries are the problem. Came back Right Ovary measures 1.7x1.46x2.11 cm w/a volume of 2.74cc. The left ovary measures 2.46x1.93x2.37 cm w/a volume of 5.88cc. Please note that I had just starting taking antibiotics two days prior to this test being done due to left pain starting again. The pain last for about 3-4 days while on antibiotics and then goes away. Is it because I am taking antibiotics or because that is my normal cycle each month but I no longer have periods, haven t for about a year now. I am afraid to not take the antibiotics when I get the pain because if it is my bowels again and I do not want to put myself in the same situation I had 2 years ago. I also have trouble having bowl movements when I am having the pain as well. I have altered my diet (more fiber)...I now take a bowel medication daily to help keep my bowels normal. and about 1 week a month I feel good. The rest of the month I am bloated, cramping, and struggle to have regular bowel movements. I take blood pressure medication linsinopril (low dose) ,and a Prilosec pill daily ( which I had chronic heart burn for 2 years before I finally gave in to Prilosec verses tums. I have also had a bowel test for cancer...came back normal. Had a colonoscopy, came back diverticula present nothing alarming...some inflammation. I had just finished taking a 20 day regiment of antibiotics when I had the colonoscopy done, so I was feeling good. Should I have a C125 test done or a trans vaginal ultrasound? I really think there is something going on with my left ovary. Also my last pap showed a cyst on my uterian wall... tested no problem. My pelvis has tipped. Sex is painful.

We examined the integrated relationships of local (nasopharyngeal) and systemic (serum) responses with bronchiolitis morbidities. METHODS In a multicenter prospective cohort study of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, we applied a network analysis approach to identify distinct networks (modules)-clusters of densely interconnected metabolites-of the nasopharyngeal and serum metabolome. We examined their individual and integrated relationships with acute severity (defined by positive pressure ventilation [PPV] use) and asthma development by age 5 years. RESULTS In 140 infants, we identified 285 nasopharyngeal and 639 serum metabolites. Network analysis revealed 7 nasopharyngeal and 8 serum modules. At the individual module-level, nasopharyngeal-amino acid, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and carnitine modules were associated with higher risk of PPV use (r>0.20; P<0.001), while serum-carnitine, amino acid and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC)/glycerophosphorylethanolamine (GPE) modules were associated with lower risk (all r<- 0.20; P<0.05). The integrated analysis for PPV use revealed consistent findings-e.g., nasopharyngeal-TCA (adjOR 2.87, 95%CI 1.68-12.2) and serum-GPC/GPE (adjOR 0.54, 95%CI 0.38-0.80) modules-and an additional module-serum-glucose-alanine cycle module (adjOR 0.69, 95%CI 0.56-0.86). With asthma risk, there were no individual associations but there were integrated associations (e.g., nasopharyngeal-carnitine module; adjOR 1.48, 95%CI 1.11-1.99). CONCLUSION In infants with bronchiolitis, we found integrated relationships of local and systemic metabolome networks with acute and chronic morbidity. Our findings advance research into the complex interplay among respiratory viruses, local and systemic response, and disease pathobiology in infants with bronchiolitis.",

The increasing use of molecular markers for DNA-based genotype signature is crucial for variety identification and traceability in the food supply chain. We collected 75 Sicilian hazelnut accessions from private and public field collections, including widely grown varieties from the Nebrodi Mountains in north east Sicily (Italy). The germplasm was fingerprinted through nine standardized microsatellites (SSR) for hazelnut identification to evaluate the genetic diversity of the collected accessions, validating SSR discrimination power. We identified cases of homonymy and synonymy among acquisitions and the unique profiles. The genetic relationships illustrated by hierarchical clustering, structure, and discriminant analyses revealed a clear distinction between local and commercial varieties. The comparative genetic analysis also showed that the Nebrodi genotypes are significantly different from the Northern Italian, Iberian, and Turkish genotypes. These results highlight the need and urgency to preserve Nebrodi germplasm as a useful and valuable source for traits of interest employable for breeding. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of molecular marker analysis to select a reference germplasm collection of Sicilian hazelnut varieties and to implement certified plants' production in the supply chain.",

METHODS This study retrospectively investigated 201 consecutive patients with Milan criteria HCCs who underwent RFA (RFA group, n = 150) or MWA (MWA group, n = 51) between January 2012 and December 2016. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), local tumor control, and treatment-related complications were compared between the two groups. Prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS Median follow-up duration was 36.7 months (range: 6.2-64.0 months). Cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 97.9%, 92.3%, and 80.6% in the MWA group and 96.4%, 87.4%, and 78.2% in the RFA group, respectively, (P = 0.450). Cumulative RFS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 93.2%, 74.4%, and 63.7% in the MWA group and 80.3%, 57.3%, and 49.6% in the RFA group, respectively, (P = 0.097). Multivariate analyses showed that variable categories \"patient age above 65 years\" (P = 0.004) and \"more than one tumor\" (P = 0.004) were associated with overall mortality, and \"patient age above 65 years\" (P = 0.048) and \"tumor size greater than 3 cm\" (P = 0.009) were associated with inferior RFS. The incidences of major complications were not significantly different between the two groups (3.3% vs 3.9%, P = 0.843). CONCLUSIONS RFA and MWA were associated with comparable safety and efficacy for HCC within the Milan criteria in challenging locations. Further study in a large, multi-center patient cohort is necessary to validate the results.",

        "instruction": "Research assignment Hi, I am a grade 12 student who is doing a research assignment on neurological disorders. Do you believe that there will ever be a bonafide cure for Multiple Sclerosis? If so, what kind of time frame would put on this cure?",
        "input": "Multiple sclerosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged. Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms. Find out why Mayo Clinic is the best place for your care. Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. They may include: - Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or the legs and trunk   - Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, often with pain during eye movement   - Prolonged double vision   - Tingling or pain in parts of your body   - Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign)   - Tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait   - Slurred speech   - Fatigue   - Dizziness   - Problems with bowel and bladder function When to see a doctor See a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons. Disease course Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting disease course. They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen signs and symptoms of MS, but these aren't considered disease relapses. About 60 to 70 percent of people with relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms, with or without periods of remission, known as secondary-progressive MS. The worsening of symptoms usually includes problems with mobility and gait. The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive MS. Some people with MS experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses. This is known as primary-progressive MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. It's considered an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys myelin (the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord). Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve may be slowed or blocked. The nerve may also become damaged itself. It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible. These factors may increase your risk of developing multiple sclerosis: - Age. MS can occur at any age, but most commonly affects people between the ages of 15 and 60.   - Sex. Women are about twice as likely as men are to develop MS.   - Family history. If one of your parents or siblings has had MS, you are at higher risk of developing the disease.   - Certain infections. A variety of viruses have been linked to MS, including Epstein-Barr, the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis.   - Race. White people, particularly those of Northern European descent, are at highest risk of developing MS. People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk.   - Climate. MS is far more common in countries with temperate climates, including Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe.   - Certain autoimmune diseases. You have a slightly higher risk of developing MS if you have thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease.   - Smoking. Smokers who experience an initial event of symptoms that may signal MS are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a second event that confirms relapsing-remitting MS. There are no specific tests for MS. Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough medical history and examination. Your doctor may then recommend: - Blood tests, to help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to MS. Tests to check for specific biomarkers associated with MS are currently under development and may also aid in diagnosing the disease. - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), in which a small sample of fluid is removed from your spinal canal for laboratory analysis. This sample can show abnormalities in antibodies that are associated with MS. Spinal tap can also help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to MS. - MRI, which can reveal areas of MS (lesions) on your brain and spinal cord. You may receive an intravenous injection of a contrast material to highlight lesions that indicate your disease is in an active phase. - Evoked potential tests, which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli, in which you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting MS, the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing MS can be more difficult in persons with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing MS symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Treatments for MS attacks - Corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, mood swings and fluid retention. - Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids. Treatments to modify progression For primary-progressive MS, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy. It slows worsening of disability in people with this type of MS. For relapsing-remitting MS, several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with MS occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate and slow the formation of new lesions. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat MS carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous MS treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting MS include: - Beta interferons. These medications are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat MS. They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of beta interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. - Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus). This humanized immunoglobulin antibody medication is the only DMT approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS. Clinical trials showed it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrevus is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Side effects may infusion-related reactions including irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, fever, and nausea among others. Ocrevus may also increase the risk of some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. - Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. - Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. - Fingolimod (Gilenya). This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include headache, high blood pressure and blurred vision. - Teriflunomide (Aubagio). This once-daily medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. It is harmful to a developing fetus and should not be used by women who may become pregnant and are not using appropriate contraception, or their male partner. - Natalizumab (Tysabri). This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe MS or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in some people. - Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada). This drug helps reduce relapses of MS by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells, but it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. - Mitoxantrone. This immunosuppressant drug can be harmful to the heart and is associated with development of blood cancers. As a result, its use in treating MS is extremely limited. Mitoxantrone is usually used only to treat severe, advanced MS. Treatments for MS signs and symptoms - Physical therapy. A physical or occupational therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises and show you how to use devices to make it easier to perform daily tasks. Physical therapy along with the use of a mobility aid when necessary can also help manage leg weakness and other gait problems often associated with MS. - Muscle relaxants. You may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in your legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may help. - Medications to reduce fatigue. - Other medications. Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with MS. To help relieve the signs and symptoms of MS, try to: - Get plenty of rest. - Exercise. If you have mild to moderate MS, regular exercise can help improve your strength, muscle tone, balance and coordination. Swimming or other water exercises are good options if you're bothered by heat. Other types of mild to moderate exercise recommended for people with MS include walking, stretching, low-impact aerobics, stationary bicycling, yoga and tai chi. - Cool down. MS symptoms often worsen when your body temperature rises. Avoiding exposure to heat and using devices such as cooling scarves or vests can be helpful. - Eat a balanced diet. Results of small studies suggest that a diet low in saturated fat but high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in olive and fish oils, may be beneficial. But further research is needed. Studies also suggest that vitamin D may have potential benefit for people with MS. - Relieve stress. Stress may trigger or worsen your signs and symptoms. Yoga, tai chi, massage, meditation or deep breathing may help. Many people with MS use a variety of alternative or complementary treatments or both to help manage their symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain. Activities such as exercise, meditation, yoga, massage, eating a healthier diet, acupuncture and relaxation techniques may help boost overall mental and physical well-being, but there are few studies to back up their use in managing symptoms of MS. Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend the use of oral cannabis extract for muscle spasticity and pain, but do not recommend cannabis in any other form for other MS symptoms due to a lack of evidence. The guidelines also do not recommend the use of herbal supplements such as Ginkgo biloba and bee venom or magnetic therapy for MS symptoms.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION High-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) is essential in characterizing achalasia subtype and the extent of affected segment to plan the myotomy starting point during per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). However, evidence is lacking that efficacy is improved by tailoring myotomy to the length of the spastic segment on HREM. We sought to investigate whether utilizing HREM to dictate myotomy length in POEM impacts postoperative outcomes. METHODS Comparative analysis of HREM-tailored to non-tailored patients from a prospectively collected database of all POEMs at our institution January 2011 through July 2017. A tailored myotomy is defined as extending at least the length of the diseased segment, as initially measured on HREM. RESULTS Forty patients were included (11 tailored versus 29 non-tailored). There were no differences in patient age (p = 0.6491) or BMI (p = 0.0677). Myotomy lengths were significantly longer for tailored compared to non-tailored overall (16.6 \u00b1 2.2 versus 13.5 \u00b1 1.8; p < 0.0001), and for only type III achalasia (15.9 \u00b1 2.4 versus 12.7 \u00b1 1.2; p = 0.0453), likely due to more proximal starting position in tailored cases (26.0 \u00b1 2.2 versus 30.0 \u00b1 2.7; p < 0.0001). Procedure success (Eckardt < 3) was equivalent across groups overall (p = 0.5558), as was postoperative Eckardt score (0.2 \u00b1 0.4 versus 0.8 \u00b1 2.3; p = 0.4004). Postoperative Eckardt score was significantly improved in the tailored group versus non-tailored for type III only (0.2 \u00b1 0.4 versus 1.3 \u00b1 1.5; p = 0.0435). A linear correlation was seen between increased length and greater improvement in Eckardt score in the non-tailored group (p = 0.0170). CONCLUSIONS Using HREM to inform surgeons of the proximal location of the diseased segment resulted in longer myotomies, spanning the entire affected segment in type III achalasia, and in lower postoperative Eckardt scores. Longer myotomy length is often more easily achieved with POEM than with Heller myotomy, which raises the question of whether POEM results in better outcomes for type III achalasia, as types I and II do not generally have measurable spastic segments.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the People\u2019s Republic of China in December 2019. Thereafter, a global logarithmic expansion of cases occurred. Some countries have a higher rate of infections despite the early implementation of quarantine. Air pollution might be related to high susceptibility to the virus and associated case fatality rates (deaths/cases*100). Lima, Peru, has the second highest incidence of COVID-19 in Latin America and also has one the highest levels of air pollution in the region. METHODS: This study investigated the association of levels of PM(2.5) exposure in previous years (2010\u20132016) in 24 districts of Lima with cases, deaths and case fatality rates for COVID-19. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate this association controlled by age, sex, population density and number of food markets per district. The study period was from March 6 to June 12, 2020. RESULTS: There were 128,700 cases in Lima and 2382 deaths due to COVID-19. The case fatality rate was 1.93%. Previous exposure to PM(2.5) (2010\u20142016) was associated with the number of COVID-19- cases (\u03b2 = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.034\u20130.107) and deaths (\u03b2 = 0.0014; 95% CI: 0.0006\u20130.0.0023) but not with the case fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for age, sex and number of food markets, the higher rates of COVID-19 in Metropolitan Lima are attributable to the increased PM(2.5) exposure in the previous years, among other reasons. Reduction in air pollution from a long-term perspective and social distancing are needed to prevent the spread of virus outbreaks.

Surgical treatment is further complicated by coexisting gastro-oesophageal reflux. No universal surgical strategy exists for this problem. METHODS A novel surgical strategy combines partial sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and hiatus hernia (HH) repair with fundoplication. A review of treating four such patients is described with objective outcome data. RESULTS Overall, solid gastric emptying improved in all, from median 350 (163-488) min pre-operatively to 108 (84-135) at 10 months (3-24) post-operatively, corresponding to 67% improvement. Primary symptoms resolved in all; however, one patient had recurrent symptoms. GERD-HRQL also improved in all, from median 23 (3-25) to 4 (0-8) at 21 months (6-30, 83% improvement). Gas bloat improved in three. All had post-operative gastroscopies showing intact repair and absent oesophagitis, with no patient requiring post-operative PPI. Patient weight reduced by median 11% (7-20) post-operatively. There was no significant peri-operative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS With careful patient selection and work-up, SG and HH repair with fundoplication may improve quality of life by coupling adequate reflux control with improved gastric emptying.",

The impact of lung disease on PH outcomes and response to treatment remains a challenging area with limited progress. Imaging with computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in patients with suspected PH when assessing for parenchymal lung disease, however, current assessments are limited by their semi-qualitative nature. Quantitative chest-CT (QCT) allows numerical quantification of lung parenchymal disease beyond subjective visual assessment. This has facilitated advances in radiological assessment and clinical correlation of a range of lung diseases including emphysema, interstitial lung disease, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Artificial Intelligence approaches have the potential to facilitate rapid quantitative assessments. Benefits of cross-sectional imaging include ease and speed of scan acquisition, repeatability and the potential for novel insights beyond visual assessment alone. Potential clinical benefits include improved phenotyping and prediction of treatment response and survival. Artificial intelligence approaches also have the potential to aid more focused study of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies by identifying more homogeneous subgroups of patients with lung disease.

There is growing evidence that the reasons for this difference are multi-factorial and need further exploration. AIM: The aim of this study was to understand better, perceptions of risk and responses to covid-19 of members of the Muslim community living in the North West of England, and to understand the facilitators and barriers to adherence to restrictions and guidance measures. METHOD: A total of 47 participants took part in 25 in-depth qualitative interviews and four focus groups (n=22) that explored perceptions of risk and responses to risk from covid-19. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Participants were aware of the mechanism of transmission of covid-19 and took steps to mitigate risk of transmission including, observing a range of hygiene practices and following social distancing guidance. Increased risk of covid-19 for BAME populations was explained largely in terms of exposure to the virus due to the types of employment people from BAME populations are employed in. Limitations both within the working environment and more generally in public spaces, was identified as problematic for effective social distancing. The closure of mosques sent out a strong message about the seriousness of the virus and religious teachings reinforced hygiene and social distancing guidelines. CONCLUSION: Across society there are people that adhere to restrictions and guidelines and those that do not. Improving local information provision and communication pathways during times of the pandemic, could aid understanding of risk and promote adherence to social distancing restrictions.

Here, an attempt has been made through in-silico high throughput screening to explore the antiviral compounds from traditionally used plants for antiviral treatments in India namely, Tea, Neem and Turmeric, as potential inhibitors of two widely studied viral proteases, main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) of the SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking study using BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2018 revealed, (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG), a tea polyphenol has a binding affinity toward both the selected receptors, with the lowest CDocker energy - 46.22 kcal mol-1 for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and CDocker energy - 44.72 kcal mol-1 for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexed with (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, which had shown the best binding affinity was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to validate its binding affinity, during which, the root-mean-square-deviation values of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-Co-crystal ligand (N3) and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro- (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate systems were found to be more stable than SARS-CoV-2 Mpro system. Further, (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate was subjected to QSAR analysis which predicted IC50 of 0.3281 nM against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Overall, (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate showed a potential binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and could be proposed as a potential natural compound for COVID-19 treatment.",

OBJECTIVE: To measure air and surface environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 virus when CPAP and HFNO are used, compared with supplemental oxygen, to investigate the potential risks of viral transmission to healthcare workers and patients. METHODS: 30 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, with a fraction of inspired oxygen \u22650.4 to maintain oxygen saturation \u226594%, were prospectively enrolled into an observational environmental sampling study. Participants received either supplemental oxygen, CPAP or HFNO (n=10 in each group). A nasopharyngeal swab, three air and three surface samples were collected from each participant and the clinical environment. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed for viral and human RNA, and positive/suspected-positive samples were cultured for the presence of biologically viable virus. RESULTS: Overall 21/30 (70%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx. In contrast, only 4/90 (4%) and 6/90 (7%) of all air and surface samples tested positive (positive for E and ORF1a) for viral RNA respectively, although there were an additional 10 suspected-positive samples in both air and surfaces samples (positive for E or ORF1a). CPAP/HFNO use or coughing was not associated with significantly more environmental contamination than supplemental oxygen use. Only one nasopharyngeal sample was culture positive. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CPAP and HFNO to treat moderate/severe COVID-19 did not appear to be associated with substantially higher levels of air or surface viral contamination in the immediate care environment, compared with the use of supplemental oxygen.",

Countries irrespective of economic status have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects of the lives, including health, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent the outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale lockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics, for example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings, restricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown strategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social interactions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown, psychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the Spanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology approach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in order to understand people's interaction over the months of this on-going coronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the pandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which declined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more positive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This leads us to speculate that the South American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the overall psychological distress.",

This study uses convolutional neural network (CNN), Zeiler and Fergus network (ZFNet), and dense convolutional network-121 (DenseNet121) architectures of deep convolutional neural network models. The proposed models are presented to provide accurate diagnosis for binary classification. The datasets were obtained from a public database. This retrospective study included 757 chest CT images (360 confirmed COVID-19 and 397 non-COVID-19 chest CT images). The algorithms were coded using the Python programming language. The performance metrics used were accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Comparative analyses are presented between the three models by considering hyper-parameter factors to find the best model. We obtained the best performance, with an accuracy of 94,7%, a recall of 90%, a precision of 100%, and an F1-score of 94,7% from the CNN model. As a result, the CNN algorithm is more accurate and precise than the ZFNet and DenseNet121 models. This study can present a second point of view to medical staff.",

        "input": "Influenza A virus is the respiratory pathogen responsible for influenza. Infection by the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus caused severe lower airway inflammation and pneumonia. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that affects the entire brachial tree, and was one of the commonest underlying medical conditions among patients hospitalized with the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infection. Although respiratory virus infections are the major causes of asthma exacerbation, the mechanism by which influenza exacerbates asthma is poorly understood. Animal models of disease comorbidity are crucial to understanding host-pathogen interactions and elucidating complex pathologies. Existing murine models of influenza virus infection in asthmatics show that asthmatic mice are highly resistant to influenza virus infection, which contradicts clinical observations in humans. Here, we developed a murine model of influenza virus/asthma comorbidity using NC/Nga mice, which are highly sensitive to allergic reactions such as atopic dermatitis and allergic airway inflammation. This model was then used to examine the impact of allergic airway inflammation on lung pathology in the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infected mice. The results showed that induction of acute allergic airway inflammation in pre-existing influenza virus infection had additive effects on exacerbation of lung pathology, which mirrors findings in human epidemiological studies. In contrast, pre-existing allergic airway inflammation protected from subsequent influenza virus infection, which was compatible with those of previous murine models of influenza virus infection in asthmatic mice. These variable outcomes of this murine model indicate that the temporal relation between allergic airway inflammation and influenza virus infection might play a critical role in asthma and influenza comorbidity. Thus, this murine model will further our understanding of how influenza virus infection affects an asthmatic host and may aid the development of strategies to improve treatments and outcomes for asthmatics harboring influenza virus infection.",
